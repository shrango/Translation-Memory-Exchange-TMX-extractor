<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a kind spirit with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother that went with the flow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'm always pigeonholed, or labelled by someone who has little, if anything, to do with me and reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Personally, I have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time."</seg>
<seg id="6">"To be honest, I don't really give a damn about things like that."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "Miss Perfect" in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".</seg>
<seg id="8">The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun, eating Mexican food, the magazine reports.</seg>
<seg id="9">The question of whether she wants children makes her livid: "We women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled," the Hollywood star says.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new film, "Mother's Day - love isn't child's play", Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons.</seg>
<seg id="11">The film is released in Germany on 25 August.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experience on horseback is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a first for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horse decided it wanted to go home, and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a kilometre at this speed I was scared.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It wasn't a good experience," said Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that, his riding career came to an end again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his family toured the ALRV grounds, but he did not jump onto a horse for a photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Langer's first time in Aachen, and at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">He had been thoroughly convinced.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event.</seg>
<seg id="15">The friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Federal Cross of Merit, the Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Saturday, he met the first person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," said Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been encouraging up-and-coming talent for years.</seg>
<seg id="22">And in this vein, he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">The two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob-sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, judo player Frank Wieneke, show-jumper Alwin Schockemöhle, and, posthumously, handball player Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious gathering wandered to the show-jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was underway.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Comparing Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's economic policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He would do things totally differently, Trump says.</seg>
<seg id="9">He would repeal regulations, and lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Conversely, Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would increase taxes for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, they have similar views on infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">There has to be investment in infrastructure, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies, and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party, which is critical of the state.</seg>
<seg id="16">Consequently, Trump could lead to discussions within the party.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will become the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance, she says.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score: Once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised, then he said it should stay the same.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clinton is on the opposite side: as a minimum, she wants the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">For women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">One house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every one of them has a baby with them, the oldest of which is one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One woman holds her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks around the room inquisitively, his eyes wide.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realises she's being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the child.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you start talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of social assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich, in one of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone.</seg>
<seg id="17">Condrobs opened the centre in January, in collaboration with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Help organisation.</seg>
<seg id="18">It recently had its official opening.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not even male visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a bodyguard on the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm not exaggerating when I say that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of war, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families pin their hopes on them and send them to Europe," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="24">When women flee, other reasons are in the foreground: "Many women sneak away secretly, because they see no other way out".</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home countries, they experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That propels them forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">And it continues even while they're on the run.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the woman are alone, unprotected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you think that this stops as soon as they arrive in Germany, you'd be wrong, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even in Germany, lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommodation, and, in the worst cases, they are abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children were certainly not conceived with the woman's consent".</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything, she says.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they can't bring themselves to talk about what they experienced because they are too ashamed".</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often don't know how to get help, there needs to be more accommodation just for them, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for providing accommodation for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">When asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they covered, some answered with "no".</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia regions, for example, there is no similar accommodation offered by the government.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, floors, or individual houses, are set aside in some shared accommodation for lone women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria: there, there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Even the European Parliament's Committee on "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" stresses that women must be provided with accommodation separate from that of the men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="45">"If there is a lack of private space, or if men and women are provided with accommodation together, this can result in (perpetual) violence against women".</seg>
<seg id="46">Washing facilities, above all, should be separate, and easily accessible for women, according to the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">The extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since word has got around that we exist, we have developed a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be easy to open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="8">I lost count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russian public opinion has also turned since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's denied that emphatically.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim a victory of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is also an economic motive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has slumped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.</seg>
<seg id="33">They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.</seg>
<seg id="38">Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family are here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a rollercoaster ride.</seg>
<seg id="24">Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).</seg>
<seg id="10">On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiles convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a move that has mystified Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.</seg>
<seg id="6">I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.</seg>
<seg id="12">The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Happily, it all went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.</seg>
<seg id="11">Someone was watching over these guys today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is going to build Braunschweig's low-cost housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low-cost homes over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next council meeting, the SPD is going to put forward an "action plan for homes".</seg>
<seg id="5">But it won't be smooth sailing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Firstly, there is the question of who is actually going to build the low-cost homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, no settlement has been reached on this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD group chairman, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on municipal land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The low-cost homes could also be older homes that are renovated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground?"</seg>
<seg id="11">We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent, but if possible, 20 percent, of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will cost millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite that, according to Bratman, the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with additional tasks.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear if we will get the specialist staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">This will come to 500 homes even by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, spokeswoman for planning policy, bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step back from the target of "blending".</seg>
<seg id="31">No longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks that "the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent majority."</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they have focused on providing more building sites for detached homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world turns.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">So how does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes somebody might walk into a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">So what?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.</seg>
<seg id="30">However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on vault.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jaw-dropping on floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.</seg>
<seg id="21">While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.</seg>
<seg id="32">She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car</seg>
<seg id="2">Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't sign up for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund walks with the help of a walker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he's slowly meeting some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="14">He's walking with help, and riding a bike.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I kept saying, what's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.</seg>
<seg id="28">It gets better.</seg>
<seg id="29">You know it will get better for you.</seg>
<seg id="30">You will love your child, and your child will love you.</seg>

<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It came up to my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.</seg>
<seg id="24">Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="27">CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.</seg>
<seg id="30">Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.</seg>
<seg id="34">This one is on track to be a similar event.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Family tells the station he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.</seg>
<seg id="20">Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.</seg>
<seg id="21">No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team looks, finally, like America.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is powerful.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.</seg>
<seg id="14">And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.</seg>

<seg id="1">PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are</seg>
<seg id="20">His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid</seg>
<seg id="6">Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="9">'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.</seg>
<seg id="14">Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'</seg>

<seg id="18">Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest</seg>
<seg id="19">Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks</seg>
<seg id="20">One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being</seg>
<seg id="15">Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark</seg>
<seg id="20">Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.</seg>
<seg id="24">We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="26">That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'</seg>
<seg id="29">'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'</seg>
<seg id="30">'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.</seg>
<seg id="9">'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'</seg>
<seg id="10">'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.</seg>
<seg id="12">'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'</seg>
<seg id="16">'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'</seg>
<seg id="17">A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'</seg>
<seg id="18">All the product in question has been removed from sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.</seg>
<seg id="5">If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.</seg>
<seg id="6">You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds tricky?</seg>
<seg id="11">Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'</seg>
<seg id="12">He certainly proved his reputation during the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'</seg>
<seg id="31">Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction</seg>
<seg id="2">A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">This family are notorious and their name is notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished</seg>
<seg id="14">Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction</seg>
<seg id="33">Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low</seg>
<seg id="4">The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="2">Seville - On Sunday, FC Barcelona will fight to take their first step towards their first title of the new football season.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Catalan team will face off against FC Sevilla in an away game in Spain's Supercup; the second leg will take place three days later in Camp Nou.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two-time champions will have to face up to the defeated Cup finalists and reigning Europa League champions without Neymar, who is playing in the Olympic football tournament for Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">During training the German pulled a ligament in his knee. At least it's clear who'll be wearing the number one jersey for Barca: Claudio Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chilean international and Ter Steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision either way, allowing Bravo to wear the jersey in league games, but giving it to Ter Stegen in most of their other matches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ahead of the first compulsory game of the new season there were doubts as to the Spanish champions' fitness: they lost 0-4 to Liverpool in a friendly game on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even with 3-2 in a friendly against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and co. were not really all that convincing.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, Sevilla have to swallow their 2-3 extra-time defeat against Real Madrid in the Supercup, and are aiming for a second victory in the "Supercopa de Espana".</seg>
<seg id="12">With eleven victories, Barcelona are the current record-holders for this competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ma Long is in a league of his own, taking Gold in the table tennis</seg>
<seg id="2">Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long, from China, is the new table tennis Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the 27-year-old beat his fellow countryman and "defending champion" Zhang Jike in Rio de Janeiro 4-0 in a one-sided final (12,5,4,4).</seg>
<seg id="4">This gave the world number one the "golden grand slam", winning the World Championship, the World Cup, the final tournament of the World Tour, and the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bronze medal went to Jun Mizutani from Japan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two Chinese men made it to the final, as expected, and fought each other for the title.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was clear that, for the third time in a row, a Chinese athlete would take the singles title at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last non-Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SVS Lower Austria legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ma and Zhang were alone at the table: they had no coaches with them between sets and during time-outs.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had returned to the stands, leaving their charges alone to fight a fair battle against each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Up until now, I have played for my country."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the final, I'm playing for myself," Zhang summarised.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the game, the gold and silver medallists posed with the Chinese flag.</seg>
<seg id="14">The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ma only had to fight off his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.</seg>
<seg id="16">Afterwards, he set the pace on the table, and only let Zhang score a total of 13 points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ma's dominance meant that the match was not as exciting as expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">But nevertheless, there were some breathtaking volleys to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mizutani won the bronze medal match against 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4-1.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Belarussian had injured his rib in his quarter-final against German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and was given medical treatment, and ultimately had to content himself with fourth place.</seg>

<seg id="2">The US Republicans' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their majority, even in states that are traditionally conservative.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in Utah, formerly a Republican stronghold.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a strange moment - the multi-millionaire normally puts on a pompous, self-assured performance, but this time he expressed something analogous to doubt, as correspondents report.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had beaten 16 rivals from within the Republican camp, doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White House.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to an audience of evangelical Christians whom he asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">He blamed false reports on his candidacy, once again giving the media a dressing-down, as he is known to do.</seg>
<seg id="8">Republican strongholds are wavering</seg>
<seg id="9">Utah is normally a safe seat for the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">A poll carried out by SurveyUSA in June puts Trump and his competitor on an equal footing with Democrat Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other bodies do put Trump ahead, but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview with broadcaster CNBC, Trump was asked how he would stop Clinton's rise, replying: "In the same way I have done before".</seg>
<seg id="14">And he added: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, long holiday".</seg>
<seg id="15">He said he was just "telling the truth".</seg>
<seg id="16">If he doesn't make it because of political correctness, that's ok, Trump added.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, he said, I'd return to a very nice way of life.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to press reports, the party have threatened Trump with removing financial support for his election campaign if he is unable to do any better in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, the Republican congressional candidates would be offered more support.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Following the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics, trouble is looming for Kenya's track and field athletes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent one coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official announced that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kenya's team managers were allegedly informed of this by the doping officials.</seg>
<seg id="8">The global IAAF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investigations, stated an IAAF spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The IAAF will perform an evaluation, depending on the findings of the investigation and the steps taken by the IOC as a result," said an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) went to the doping check and alleged that he was Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample, and signed for it," explained Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya's Chef de Mission.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had the athlete's accreditation as given in the list of training checks for the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich came fourth in the 800-metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days previously, the Head of the Kenyan track & field delegation, Michael Rotich, had been sent away from the Rio games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was alleged to have told sportspeople from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">After numerous instances of doping, the IOC has been keeping a particularly close eye on Kenya for a while.</seg>
<seg id="17">When the IOC announced that it would hold more than 2000 targeted doping checks in advance of the Rio games, it also announced, unusually, that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be examined particularly closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ahead of the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti-doping law and a functioning system of checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">Following this, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Running is a national sport in Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of televised reports by ARD, the claim was made time and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a mentality of cheating at sport.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound has recently called for an investigation in Kenya to mirror that which took place into Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">This investigation proved that doping was undertaken extensively and systematically across the sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">As a result, Russia's track and field athletes were banned from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare anniversary year, the Salzburger Festspiele is putting on "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic couple just like Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">Featuring a surprise: Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical has gripped Salzburg: Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece, "West Side Story".</seg>
<seg id="5">Artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music, and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Maria.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it has a lot of Latin American influences.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American elements in its tempo and melodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect formula for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love affair with Tony with wistfulness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it's musically unusual!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there's Maria's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">As she says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".</seg>
<seg id="17">So she's clever, and naive of course, and full of passion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"She's very like me, like my Italian personality as a girl from Rome," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">We are so honoured to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an incredibly generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and so passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">For him, conducting is a need.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in all his movements, his glances - it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey: Kurdish community faces mass exodus</seg>
<seg id="2">"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," says the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World foundation, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection, fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, this could even grow to "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, President of the association.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crackdown instigated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term I'm expecting ten thousand, in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition," said the President of the Association, Ali Toprak, to "Die Welt" newspaper on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result, 500,000 Kurds are already on the run within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the unsuccessful coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks have been added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is unacceptable that a country that takes in refugees is also producing them," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Association complained about the deliberate relocating of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and Alevi towns.</seg>
<seg id="12">He thinks that Erdogan did this to encourage the remaining Kurds to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted "as harshly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".</seg>
<seg id="15">A "witch-hunt" is also underway in Germany against those critical of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past few months, I have no longer felt safe in Germany for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">Being singled out as a Gülen-supporter is career-destroying for teachers and other academics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," said the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World Foundation, Ercan Karakoyun, to "Die Welt" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reports, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persecution.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the reference date of June 30, this amounted to 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all people entitled to asylum (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">These figures do not include people who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under the constitution, only individuals suffering political persecution, i.e., on the part of the state, are entitled to asylum.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals hear nothing about the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood this.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the state parliament elections will not take place at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers in the state, in Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals - and are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are also practical problems to consider: during the holidays, volunteers who put up signs, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count the votes at the end, are hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, election day and the last day of the holidays, people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must put up with one more election without the people being consulted.</seg>
<seg id="10">The heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there's something at stake: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, is fearing for his seat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU, according to polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting to see how Neuling AfD carves things up, and whether a coalition can be formed with what's left at the end.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign, as can be seen from his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is travelling around the region, distributing roses and chatting a bit with people, just as his legendarily taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seelering has got cold feet, blaming Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will probably cost him his job.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The CDU have invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to two mass rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group wasn't right: there were more people from North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than people from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The majority probably came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it won't do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkal for once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the north-east CDU is generally dispensing with the normal election events with parasols and balloons in market squares and outside shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Kokert, that will only play a "minor role".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">They are suffering like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present across large swathes of the region.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing: "You have got to go where it hurts, or where the people are: village fetes, Golden Wedding anniversaries, you have to make use of every birthday party."</seg>
<seg id="28">Sellering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to polls, the social democrats have 22 percent, behind their partners the CDU (25), and only fractionally ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a clear victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday issue, and are waging their election war predominantly online.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online election campaign" is what the regional chairperson Claudia Müller has dubbed it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, the Greens are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, their top candidate, is currently crossing Mecklenburg's lakes on a houseboat - and is having a nice time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her view? "Having an election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern isn't all that bad".</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 redevelopment: restaurants are suffering from the closure</seg>
<seg id="2">There are hardly any problems with the speed at which the B27 is being redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is praise from all quarters for the people responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They have done everything so speedily," Elvira Texlaff at the Jet petrol station explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are also no delays.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the start of the week, the construction site could be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation within the town has improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">Residents can now drive on both sides of the B 27 out of Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">There seem to be fewer drivers taking alternative routes through the town.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were some serious complaints made," said Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Residents in Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to put up with more traffic noise because people were looking for ways to cut through, trusting their satnav more than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">This led to some lorries hurtling through residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">The commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were considerable infringements," said King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, things have quietened down.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is only a small consolation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to show their hand.</seg>
<seg id="22">But nobody we questioned hid the fact that the B 27 redevelopment had led to a drop in profits.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some have been affected more than others.</seg>
<seg id="24">People who have little to do with "end customers", i.e. if they make products for other companies, have hardly been affected by the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz talked of "a slight loss, at the most", but also admitted that "there had been a lack of passing trade".</seg>
<seg id="26">Bars and restaurants along the road had been the hardest hit.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse (previously Krone), expressed himself clearly.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has threatened our very existence.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's not just him: all restaurants have been "hit hard".</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil stayed away.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro of profit we make.</seg>
<seg id="32">He reckons that profits slumped by "far more than 50 percent".</seg>
<seg id="33">The road redevelopment "set back" his businesses "by two years".</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to let half of his staff go.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be financial compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other districts where people have acted more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">Despite all the complains, Göhner is convinced that his restaurant will survive.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business moved there back in 1715, he said, referring to its long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the complicated traffic system.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive past, other places are also nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regulars will return once the redevelopment works have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner believes that the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele mark the biggest crisis his restaurant has suffered in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction works, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti-terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the most recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now putting forward a host of security measures.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does residential status have to do with terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière is playing the conciliator.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are not asking too much of anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will also be involved in that.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Minister of the Interior, however, he is responsible for results, and for reaching an "achievable agreement" within the coalition, he says.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, they are more comprehensive as a result.</seg>
<seg id="13">One thing was already known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove German passports from jihadis with dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will be difficult issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite this, he believes they are achievable, and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have a lot to offer: He is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked, and present their social media accounts for security checks.</seg>
<seg id="22">He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally tricky.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of it also seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is raised: What does that actually have to do with security and terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says, it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.</seg>
<seg id="30">Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in neighbouring countries: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is a large amount of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, elections are looming.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">First a nasty argument about the Federal Police Force's equipment, then about an ideas-gathering event for security and politics-related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union, at which a burka ban and the renunciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department heads.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here.</seg>
<seg id="39">He does not think that dual citizenship will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have dealt with the discussions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="42">And he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is "achievable" for his coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are few things inside it that could cause problems.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself.</seg>
<seg id="46">SPD Head Sigmar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issue, albeit sensitively at first, saying that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen gets off lightly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite the diesel scandal, global delivery figures are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="3">But things aren't quite as rosy in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">The recall has led to fuss about one term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thanks to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, the VW core brand suffered, particularly in Western Europe, thereby affecting overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.</seg>
<seg id="8">Globally, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month the year before.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Head of brand sales, Jürge Stackmann, blamed July's poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, some key markets saw "changed economic climates", which led to fewer purchases.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU had also had an impact, a spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the emissions scandal first began, the books are once again in the red.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Chinese market is a source of great support for VW.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, Lower Saxony's own brand, which was most affected, has got off lightly from the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, there is a minus in the books for deliveries amounting to 0.9 percent of 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Head of sales at the company, Fred Kappler, was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a global total of 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW has called 2.5 million vehicles back to workshops to be refitted.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of modifying the vehicles VW emphasised that refitting them would have no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the vehicles have been modified, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse.</seg>
<seg id="23">After modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Legal intricacies are the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Focus" reported that Volkswagen would provide its German customers with a guarantee for modified diesel cars nonetheless.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on the Monday previous.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigative committee and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW took on the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse as a result of the modification, and all vehicle values relevant to type approval would remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as has been mentioned in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">Volkswagen believes that the broad term "guarantee" could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the new software, even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also in the customers' interest to prevent confusion with guarantee clauses for any other faults that have nothing at all to do with the emissions scandal.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why VW will not be using the term "guarantee".</seg>

<seg id="1">The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2">Managing Director of the bank, Josef Paul, said on Thursday that "this only applies to 139 customers with 40 million euros in their current accounts or day-to-day accounts".</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German Banks believes this is an isolated case, and does not see it as a sign: normal savers "need not worry about being hit with penalty interest on the pennies they've put aside".</seg>
<seg id="4">If banks invest money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay penalty interest of 0.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">From September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.</seg>
<seg id="8">For some time, he has been managing 40 million euros that could be withdrawn any day, and that he is unable to make use of.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank, and costing 0.4 percent," the bank CEO said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I cannot put 4000 euros aside for every million."</seg>
<seg id="11">He is passing on the costs under the "polluter pays" principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: "I have already been through four raids, I don't want a fifth!" the bank's managing director said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers have been understanding, and have switched to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a small number moved to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring significant costs".</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a permanent basis, from a business perspective".</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, some German banks have increased the fees they charge for account management, credit cards or transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thuringia's "Volks- und Raffeisen Bank" in Altenburger Land hit the headlines in 2014 when their Skatbank branch imposed penalty interest on investments of more than three million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to pay fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that".</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said that, in Tegernsee, there was "clientele who were rather better off in terms of assets."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That can be a problem for a small bank," if the bank is looking after their money for free.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Cooperative Bank of Gmund was founded in 1911, and has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">Spokesperson Ernst said that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses".</seg>
<seg id="25">The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high".</seg>
<seg id="26">Competition is fierce, and there is the risk that investors will move to competitors.</seg>
<seg id="27">Customers in Germany will not put up with that, broadly speaking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are YouGov's results true?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I suppose I am," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.</seg>
<seg id="18">His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.</seg>
<seg id="19">"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More of the product side, less of the music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "art vinyl."</seg>
<seg id="59">But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="61">But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here comes the enforcement trailer</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany's speeders will have to get used to the new generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being trialled, which are supposed to be particularly effective at catching those who drive too fast.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-looking enforcement trailer made by Vitronic, a company form Wiesbaden, could be used at accident blackspots, for example, where it is too dangerous for the police to go.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, roadworks on a motorway, or a bridge that is due to be repaired, and therefore has a temporary speed limit often lack the infrastructure to support a fixed speed camera to ensure that speed limits are being adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="5">It can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points.</seg>
<seg id="6">The enforcement trailer is autonomous: its battery lasts for five days of continuous measurement, and data is transferred in encrypted form via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks to laser measuring technology, all vehicles across several lanes can be tracked at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and driving bans based on time, lane or vehicle type can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">When powered up, the manufacturer says that any car with a trailer coupling can move the trailer.</seg>
<seg id="10">To prevent it from simply being stolen, it sinks down when measuring, making its wheels disappear into the armoured, bullet-proof exterior.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, the speed camera's in-built alarm system is designed to protect it from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used in them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cameras: recently France ordered 100 of them, after ordering 150 the year before.</seg>

<seg id="2">Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has been some journey for GB.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.</seg>
<seg id="22">Which is pretty much how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle</seg>
<seg id="2">There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, it was touch and go.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they don't it goes everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It alters your outlook a bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.</seg>
<seg id="33">We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">This feels so much better," she said.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Assocation "sets an example for the entirety of Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water supply association as a role-model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">That was how the association was described in a segment on Bavarian radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the Association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Veitensteingruppe's work was described as "setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="8">Rupert Göller is behind it all: he worked as an employee of the Association for 31 years, and has been its Managing Director for 28.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has now gone into retirement at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitensteingruppe Drinking Water Supply Association has its headquarters in Kottendorf in the commune of Breitbrunn, and provides 150,000 cubic metres of water annually, supplying 32 villages and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communes of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the municipality of Baunach are also members.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and communes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), looks back to when Ruper Göller was brought on as a water officer in 1985, and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks were very varied, ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tasks, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions, through to getting involved in emergencies at weekends," the chairman said.</seg>
<seg id="15">She pointed out some exceptional successes, including commissioning and opening the new spring (1994), purchasing land near the new spring (1998), compensating farmers, renovating the elevated tanks (1999), creating a new computer management system (2004), and renewing some of the water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Things never stopped, and renovations were always underway: water means life, and drinking water is the most important foodstuff of all.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable, and upstanding service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He put his heart and soul into the Water Supply Association, and lived for it as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago he gave a presentation at the Water Forum for the District of Lower Franconia as a true practitioner of the Veitensteingruppe's successful nitrate reduction concept.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received considerable appreciation and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">For his part, Rupert Göller praised water officer Alfons Griebel, who had worked alongside him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water officer, and he was a loyal lad.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">From his perspective, the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the largest challenge and most difficult shift was when the pipe broke on the Kirchlauter elevated tank on 3 January one year.</seg>
<seg id="26">We had to work through the night at minus 17 degrees to ensure the locality would be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply from the new spring was sometimes only maintained because the elevated tank at Pettstadt was filled by hosepipe.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will be Rupert Göller's successor.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 35-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide (in the district of Stormarn).</seg>
<seg id="3">"The man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator is on the run, she said, and he is officially being sought.</seg>
<seg id="5">This search is now happening across Germany, because Sven S. might be travelling by car.</seg>
<seg id="6">The man is around 1.8 m tall, muscular, sun-tanned, and has a bald patch.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police have now issued a photo of him.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it is a couple of years old.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man now has a bald patch.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man should not be approached.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police believe he may still be carrying a weapon.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.</seg>
<seg id="13">The police are talking of a "crime passionelle".</seg>
<seg id="14">The victim was apparently born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="15">The police force in Lübeck dealing with the crime initially did not want to disclose any information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is a homicide."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - There's a ray of hope for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">This too will not be levied against the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self-generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's positive efforts are particularly important for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is the first step within our "steel is the future" campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This needs to be followed by other steps."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allowances," explained IG Metall's CEO, Jörg Hofmann, in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">The situation improved slightly during spring of this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel, on the other, economic prospects in China brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how long prices will remain perked up for.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prices had plateaued recently, he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in Germany's steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief spike in May, the amounts produced shrunk for a second consecutive month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the start of the year, production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing is good for the elderly</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy, and generally more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">And additionally, she's doing something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, says Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most elderly people sing in a choir and share the enjoyment they get from music with like-minded people, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regularly spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also experienced this in her choir: "Arranging and organising things with people, being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other people".</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be demanding in the positive sense, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a controlled manner.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you push your lungs to their limits regularly, you will not run out of breath as quickly in day-to-day life.</seg>
<seg id="14">And if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age, too, singing is the perfect hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a really special effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations.</seg>
<seg id="16">For older generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Song texts, and melodies in particular, can even be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past.</seg>
<seg id="19">Singing also demands particular mental exertion, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">In particular, older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="23">A happy audience is great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even one's self-esteem is boosted by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being able to show yourself that by practising for a long time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength.</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are enough good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - even if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You're not singing by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there?</seg>
<seg id="29">The elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, many towns offer an overview of the choirs in their region.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can approach the parish or churchwarden directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many choirs for the elderly can also be found online.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours to help you look things up online.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you're interested in singing, you should absolutely join a choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and is a kind of release - no matter how old you are.</seg>

<seg id="1">Female cats react more sensitively than male cats to the mewls of their kittens</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists in Hanover have researched the effect kittens' cries have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can tell how agitated kittens are by their miaowing.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react ten percent quicker to kittens who sound to be in great distress, the scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University of Hanover discovered.</seg>
<seg id="6">Male cats do respond to kittens' cries - but always to the same extent.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is clear that the acoustic differences between the miaows of kittens that are more or less agitaged are either imperceptible or unimportant for male cats," the biologists Wiebke Konerding, from MHH, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous experiment the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of a kitten's miaow changes depending on how urgently they need help.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nine adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH's animal husbandry programme were examined.</seg>
<seg id="11">Firstly, they were played the sound of a kitten who had been taken from the birthing box and separated from its mother and siblings for three minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then they were played the sound of a more agitated cat, which had also been lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the low sample size, the researchers believe the results to be significant.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who did not have their offspring, were able to differentiate between miaows," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agitated kitten.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate, or may develop as the animal reaches sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the male cats reacted at all," the biologist said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have researched women's and men's reactions to babies' cries on multiple occasions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even in this field a few studies showed that woman reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they had their own children or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Podolski and "Gala" are shooting for the Supercup</seg>
<seg id="2">Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for the former football star Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.</seg>
<seg id="5">An important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ahead of the duel between arch-rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual".</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July, the government emphasised that this would not affect citizens' daily life.</seg>
<seg id="8">This does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the imam Fethulla Gülen, who is believed to be responsible for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="9">And this doesn't stop for football.</seg>
<seg id="10">The state prosecutor has issued a warrant for the arrest of former star striker Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükür is accused of being a follower of the imam Fethullah Gülen, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds responsible for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the state of emergency, declared for ninety days, will continue until October, it is having practically no effect on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Wednesday, Erdogan announced that the night-time "democracy vigils" in public places across the country have come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sport - like the entire country - is divided into those who support Erdogan, and those who do not.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fans of the workers' club Besiktas, in particular, are not traditionally counted among the President's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the strict rejection of military coups is what brings most Turks together, in the light of dramatic historical events.</seg>
<seg id="18">And even the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">For cup winners Gala, it will once again depend on Lukas Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season: with 17 goals and nine assists across all competitions, the 31-year-old closed his first season as his club's top scorer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the goal that led to a 1-0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The "Fanatik" newspaper praised him, saying "he was the best player on the pitch."</seg>
<seg id="23">He finished the season in style, and secured the cup for his team.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record-holders came to a happy end.</seg>
<seg id="25">After their knockout in the heats for the Champions League, the "Lions" also left the Europa League early on.</seg>
<seg id="26">They only reached sixth place in the Süper Lig.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The cup was the only chance to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We did it - and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">Winners Besiktas saw a better year of play.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig's star goalkeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also why fans are hoping that the 31-year-old returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gomez, under contract at AC Florenz and only on loan to Besktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation.</seg>
<seg id="34">"But if Mario wants to come here, all he has to do is say," "Kicker" specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fikret Orman as saying.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, the star would have to be prepared to give up around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, as Orman made clear: "We cannot pay the salary that Florenz do".</seg>

<seg id="1">Despite doping: These athletes are still in with a chance of winning medals in Rio</seg>
<seg id="2">Justin Gatlin, aged 34, has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and 2006).</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from taking her place on the start line.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other track athletes who have been found guilty can only laugh - they are in Rio competing for medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who appealed against her doping conviction shortly before the games to enable herself to compete, was booed and shouted at as she started her 100-metre breaststroke race.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: She waltzed into the pool with a smile plastered on her face, a deliberately provocative entrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">As it became clear that she would not take the gold medal, the audience cheered enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial track athletes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since being banned, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion is running faster than ever before: covering 100m in 9.80 seconds, he is the world number one, and is Usain Bolt's major challenger.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion was handed a six-month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxycodone.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 29-year-old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (discus/Croatia): in 2011, the 2012 Olympic Chamption, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methyhexaminine.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic said that she had not knowingly taken the drug, and was banned for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">This year's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merrit (200, 400 4x400m relay/USA): Champion at the Beijing Olympics and two-time 400m World Champion, Merrit tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">Merritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world in the 200m and the 400m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (hammer, Belarus): There is hardly another athlete who has been retrospectively stripped of so many medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was proved to have been involved in testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now 40 years old, he was also stripped of his 2004 Olympic silver medal for doping with steroids, and his 2006 European Champion title for testosterone misuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">His bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics was also taken away, but it was returned to him following a decision by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 80.04m he is at second place in the global rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May, but will still be on the start line in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 29-year-old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s ban was lenient, and ended as early as July 13.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Thomas Schnöll, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said early on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She has some cuts, he says, and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">She plans to return home at the start of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumpon.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a result.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explosion, which occurred near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, which led to the death of a civil servant.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several casualties.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are assuming that the attacks were coordinated".</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to speculate on possible motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is just local sabotage, limited to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Over the past few days, the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Small-scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand, but they are rarely directed at tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all times.</seg>
<seg id="29">The provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings, have been issued with a high security alert (security level 3).</seg>
<seg id="30">After skirmishes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the population, people are advised against all but essential travel to these districts.</seg>
<seg id="31">The rest of the country is on an increased security alert (security level 2).</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will give the military large-scale influence even in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Head of the junta, and Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stability, an improved economic climate and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to quell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict so far.</seg>
<seg id="38">A little under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the most bloody attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" movement in its sights.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several regional authorities had done so, the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has also put the group on a watchlist.</seg>
<seg id="3">"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Muslim migrants or migrants from the Middle East were vilified in an extremist manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we will also be monitoring the movement from henceforth.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It fights against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of national identity through foreigners".</seg>
<seg id="8">Bodies protecting the constitution across nine federal states - Bremen, Bavarian, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already have the "Identitäre" under observation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with regional authorities to come to its decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups such as the "Identitäre Bewegung" are trying to approach their target group on their level," said the head of constitutional protection.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists attempt to speak to them in young people's own language, often with pop music.</seg>
<seg id="12">Radical Islamists and right-wing extremists both do this.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">This propaganda is designed to provoke an emotional response in people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, there have been reports from several federal states pointing out contact between members of the "Identitäre" movement and AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said he had no information on this.</seg>
<seg id="19">In terms of constitutional protection, potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the party in question - in this case, the AfD - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremists.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore, the decisive factor is whether these people exert a controlling influence over the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This has not been noted.</seg>
<seg id="23">With regard to the clear increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of a new right-wing terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, over the past few years, we have determined that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the "Old School Society" group or the "Freitaler Group".</seg>
<seg id="26">It can absolutely be the case that additional right-wing terrorist groups or small gatherings come to exist, and plan attacks on asylum seekers, refugee shelters, or for other far-right motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, there is no Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of far-right terrorism that we can discern.</seg>
<seg id="28">The groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had previously not been involved in the far-right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is frightening.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of those suspected of carrying out the attacks on asylum centers were not viewed as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or members of the far-right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"This means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism".</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation</seg>
<seg id="2">Olympic athletes or world records aren't always the only things to hit the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was used.</seg>
<seg id="6">Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the next-fastest competitor, taking place 59 out of 59.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it was his not-quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why was the 24-year-old taking part in the Olympic games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most athletes from Ethiopia run, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte prepared himself for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames were soon doing the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media outlets dubbed him "Robel the whale".</seg>
<seg id="16">With reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod".</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons were also made with "Eric the Eel".</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race also drew media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was then greeted by wild cheering.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was 22 years old at the time, and had learnt to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.</seg>

<seg id="2">Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">His resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self-evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research firm GfK: After another round of disappointing figures and the resignation of the managing director, the firm, fifth in its sector globally, is on the brink of a personal new start.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The managing director of GfK's supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already announced that he will be leaving the supervisory committee with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, who is currently a member of the board of directors, will take over the management of the board on 1 September.</seg>
<seg id="9">Officially, he will take on the role of "board spokesman" until Hartmann's successor has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company cited "different viewpoints" on long-term business direction as the reason behind the resignation.</seg>
<seg id="11">A company spokesman did not give further details on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investment circles, on Friday it was said that shareholders were greatly disappointed by the lack of success following the restructuring programme implemented years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartman has headed up GfK since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The benefits of the restructuring programme will only become visible after 5 years," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result of GfK's recent poor figures, every shareholder would be a little unsettled, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If that were the case at BMW, the quants would be too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">After suffering losses in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop losing money in the second quarter of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 lower than it had been in the same quarter of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="20">Compared to the first six months of the year, turnover (721.2 million euros) had shrunk by 3.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">The company's reduced value because of the difficult economic climate had impacted second-quarter profits, in particular.</seg>

<seg id="1">From 1 October 2016, fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros as previously, 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp, and 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros) for Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="2">The sewage fee for the sewage works in Azendorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement works.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an estimated calculation, sewage fees in Azendorf will then come to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the district administration of Kulmbach approved the budget, it was determined that these sewage plants were underfunded.</seg>
<seg id="5">The market town of Kasendorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig a little deeper.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town.</seg>
<seg id="9">Between October 2016 and September 2020, overfunding and underfunding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste, namely between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a pear.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution, expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euros, for example, seem major.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plants, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants in Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Azendorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old, and needs to be completely overhauled; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged, its sewage sludge removed, and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same is true for electricity costs: in the previous calculations for 2011/2012, they are far below their current levels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinhäuser pointed out that, even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants, the expenses for running and maintaining them "were significantly impacted".</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, Schmidt expanded, the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">From Steinhäuser's perspective, the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run, especially as the area covered by Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any missteps quickly enter the public record.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."</seg>
<seg id="9">And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.</seg>
<seg id="12">But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."</seg>
<seg id="25">Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says</seg>
<seg id="2">Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no clue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.</seg>
<seg id="10">However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was on that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've made a complete turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.</seg>
<seg id="24">She is on a roll.</seg>
<seg id="25">So is Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may be a regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.</seg>
<seg id="28">This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.</seg>
<seg id="30">From this, trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The trampoliner's vector is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.</seg>
<seg id="39">And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent Protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia about to crack?</seg>
<seg id="6">For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that may be changing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is changing as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="59">"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even reused the lights from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are brown-rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.</seg>
<seg id="27">After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.</seg>
<seg id="39">One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The new location has other perks.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I've needed to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."</seg>
<seg id="9">Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Coe grimaced.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was fabulously out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the cream-puff incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="3">He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the Syrian people.</seg>
<seg id="4">He risked everything to save other people's lives.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the 30-year-old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, according to Bild newspaper, had saved the lives of 60,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="7">2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bombed-out houses and perform first-aid in the war zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are the heroes of the war in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="9">Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11-hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="10">It made the Syrian a glowing figurehead amidst the horror of the war.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad."</seg>
<seg id="12">"If I were to die saving lives, I would think that God saw me as a martyr."</seg>
<seg id="13">Shortly before Omar himself became a victim of an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Helicopters had released four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.</seg>
<seg id="15">One woman and two children were killed, and seven people have been left with breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," quoted Bild as his last words before he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks generally only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and has swum through the North Atlantic at 1km/h right through to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150.</seg>
<seg id="7">Greenland sharks swim leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">The five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues wrote an article in "Science", the specialist journal, about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's crazy," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock about this lifespan - which is a world record for a vertebrate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that evolutionary biologists had long thought that Greenland sharks had been around for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were simply lacking the proof.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow speed was measured by researchers off Svalbard, who fitted six animals with a tracker.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may be the case that they hunt down sleeping animals, or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for corpses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks caught in the depths of the North Atlantic by fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off the coast of Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.</seg>
<seg id="23">This core of the eye's lens comes into being even before the shark is born, and the proteins in it are not renewed subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores.</seg>
<seg id="25">Consequently, they were likely born after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments released large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 monitor gave a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record-holding shark, at 502 centimetres, was apparently 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was already known that female Greenland sharks first had offspring when they were more than four metres long.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals, 392 centimetres long, was likely on the threshold of sexual maturity, and had an age of 156, it seems that Greenland sharks take at least 150 years to be able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such Methuselahs predominantly live in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">The animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.</seg>
<seg id="38">This is because their volume increases much quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">By contrast, a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.</seg>
<seg id="3">The committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert Putz' announcement that "we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out".</seg>
<seg id="4">After plot, parcelling and accessibility questions had been answered, and applications for measurements had been made, there was nothing standing in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (near Binderstraße - development section 1) to interested parties.</seg>
<seg id="5">The communal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural, peaceful residential commune of Schönau will attract young families and older people alike.</seg>
<seg id="6">As said, people prepared to build on these sites should apply in the town hall from now, and the communal council will probably discuss giving out the plots in its September meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">So that it would be able to answer questions on the movement of additional businesses, in connection with the creation of jobs, the communal council decided to amend the space usage plan first re-drawn in spring of this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," said Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London.</seg>
<seg id="5">Registration in the UK is all that has been required to date for the "EU passport".</seg>
<seg id="6">This is generally used by large US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board.</seg>
<seg id="10">While Paris has the headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry, like Dublin, its infrastructure lets it down.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the city's easily available business properties are a win.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," said Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rents for top-class business properties are 50% higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt can offer better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a table compiled by management consultants Mercer, the city was ranked 7th, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37 th.</seg>
<seg id="19">And even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "Thanks to its already strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could be able to attract additional banks and investors," IW concluded.</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also to do with strength ratios: According to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="3">In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously many used spears to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.</seg>
<seg id="10">When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.</seg>
<seg id="12">A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and shocked by the incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is in itself a great shame.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">That needs no explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the code was now added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.</seg>
<seg id="8">This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A robbery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cash-and-carry of Rewe XXL on Walbröl's Gerberstraße.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered brandished a gun and demanded that staff at the cash-and-carry hand over cash. They made a run for it on foot, and then probably got into a silver VW Golf.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police did not report how much money had been stolen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Between 1.6 and 1.7 m tall, the perpetrators were relatively short.</seg>
<seg id="6">The drinks cash-and-carry can be accessed directly from the Rewe supermarket's car park, and is tricky to observe.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and then fled, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladern ring road) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi-storey car park.</seg>

<seg id="2">Children and young people from the youth work day group/social group work project from the child protection league of Nagold spent eight gloriously happy days with their social workers during the summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lively group spent the first week of the school holidays in the peacefully-located Hartwäldle holiday camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were several day trips on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="5">One trip saw the group head to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another saw them visit Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour around the world-famous cloisters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The third trip took the group to Pforzheim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The group learnt lots about how the Celts lived and what they ate in the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf.</seg>
<seg id="9">On warm dates, the group cooled off at the Tiefensee lake in Maulbronn: perfect for jumping into, swimming around in, and paddling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Children and carers cooked their own favourite meals, such as mini German spätzle dumplings in a sour sauce, traditional Seebronner Pfännle and Iselshauser Bloff, English breakfast, and Tübingen-style bolognese.</seg>
<seg id="11">During workshops, children could practise baktik, make beautiful jewellery with pearls and stones, or create a Roman windmill game from wood.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other highlights of the summer camp included fishing in a nearby pond, spending the evenings around a campfire, and the concluding "Gala Night".</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the chaplaincy of Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna went on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">They covered four stages together.</seg>
<seg id="4">The committee of upper ministrants for St. Anna had decided to prepare for and go on a pilgrimage lasting several days to bridge the gap to the next pilgrimage to Rome for all ministrants, likely to take place in two years' time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage sites were discussed, and a decision was finally made to go to the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, to mark the holy year of mercy, this year the gates of mercy opened for this at Freiburg cathedral are a particular pilgrimage site.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 children from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the previous evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">They took the train from Horb to the starting point of Villingen, where the Cathedral of Our Lady is found. They started their pilgrimage from the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even when they were out and about, the children took breaks at wayside crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from the pilgrims' songbook they had put together themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The rectory of each parish they reached was available for them to stay in overnight.</seg>
<seg id="12">At each stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for creating a delicious, nourishing dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second day saw them head towards Gütenbach, via Furtwangen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, they set off on the section towards St. Peter, the most demanding section, seeing them climb around 500 metres in altitude in sweltering heat, and then descend again.</seg>
<seg id="15">They earned the reward of barbecueing together by the swimming pond.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning session on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive cloisters of St. Peter, they started off on the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon, visibly relieved and happy, and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">A brief moment was taken to thank God.</seg>
<seg id="19">The evening mass in the cathedral saw the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site welcomed by Chaplain Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day, there was time to look around the city, located in the region of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon they took the train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of camaraderie.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.</seg>
<seg id="5">And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel for gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no better way to win it.</seg>
<seg id="20">After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."</seg>
<seg id="24">We all as a team came together in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy's.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You get to win it with your mates.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="39">They finished in 3:51.943.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.</seg>
<seg id="6">As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.</seg>
<seg id="23">But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She's walking for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.</seg>
<seg id="28">She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="8">The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ahead of the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA, a polling institute, on behalf of "Bild" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in office, this will not be possible in Berlin, according to the poll.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the SPD was the strongest party in both states, with good chances of putting forward the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent to 24 percent in five years.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the poll, this puts the party only slightly above the CDU, who had 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Left and the AfD will fight over third place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Left had 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), and, with 19 percent, the AfD could be in the regional parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite small losses (from 8.7 percent to 6 percent), the Greens will return to Schwerin's regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="11">The NPD and the FPD, with 3 percent each, will not be represented in the regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll, the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin's elections to the House of Representatives (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU would only take 18 percent, after having taken 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">This would put them behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left, with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time, with 14 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FPD could hope to return, but the Pirates, by contrast, would miss out - unlike in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone</seg>
<seg id="2">Email and the Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Its successors have now conquered the world - but its manufacturer is in the midst of a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, and harder to hold.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, it was quite bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The in-built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high-resolution selfies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, an iPhone holds at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">The device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a couple of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover, billing it as "the office you can fit in your pocket".</seg>
<seg id="13">The new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax.</seg>
<seg id="14">You could even access websites via a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was a calculator, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded open like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">This revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2015, the average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">In August 1996, nobody had any idea that the Communicator heralded the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today, everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smartphones are a success story - even if the same cannot be said for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">For many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were around two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone make up 555 million of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of innumerable app providers and telecommunications firms.</seg>
<seg id="30">An entire industry has now sprung up around smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed easily via touchscreen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphant march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who used to dominate the market, lost out.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry had to fight for its existence.</seg>
<seg id="36">Apple, and Asian providers such as Samsung, now hold sway.</seg>
<seg id="37">20 years after their invention, smartphones are a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nowadays, every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all need to learn to put our phones down from time to time," said Janina Kugel, Siemens HR Director.</seg>
<seg id="40">Being permanently contactable has become a blessing and a curse.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="9">A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it possible to avoid impact?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're spinning as fast as they ever will.</seg>
<seg id="8">At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star steps down</seg>
<seg id="2">Alex Rodriguez' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm saying goodbye to both of them," the 14-time All Star Major League Baseball (MLB) player explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">He signed a ten-year contract, which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("runs"), for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005, the Yankees, he has reached rather a few milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">Along with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the pitch, his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial.</seg>
<seg id="14">As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "biogenesis scandal".</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his final days didn't go off without a bang.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few games, Rodriguez had to sit on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job isn't about a retirement tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job is about trying to win every game," stated Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nevertheless, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who has been rumoured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, had the support of the fans of Yankees' arch rivals, Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," the fans sang as they were defeated 4:9 by Rodriguez' team.</seg>

<seg id="1">2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Busted: After a sample tested positive for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games have been overshadowed by the first official cases of doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">One now-banned athlete had almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used to mask drugs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The international sport tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time that she had been banned from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the 100m Butterfly final - missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle heats on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a hearing and to have her B sample opened.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision".</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my fourth test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and according to BNT, a B sample also tested postive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up immediately to criticise the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been banned".</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost all the weightlifters from the nation, which has been plagued by doping, were not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ahead of the athletes' start, the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, China's earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">Camille Lacourt, from France, spoke out harshly against Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang's pee is purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, Sun was at the middle of an argument with Mack Horton, from Australia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for drug cheats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out for a three-month ban.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: This is how perfidiously hackers extort ransom money</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - with success.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany by Malwarebytes, the malware defence specialists, 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one, two, or several attacks involving extortion software in the past twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, around 20 percent of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ransom demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful in that domain, the ransom money they can demand is significantly higher than it would be for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adverts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then perpetrators discovered extortion software.</seg>
<seg id="11">Private users were initially the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware follows a simple pattern: Once activated on a user's computer, it seeks out files that have not been edited for a long time, like Word, Excel or database files, as well as image and video archives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ransomware encrypts these files, and deletes the originals for good.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, the software presents the extortioner's demands.</seg>
<seg id="15">The victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files.</seg>
<seg id="16">But while it's a personal photo database that's at play for private users, it's sensitive customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, the damage from a ransomware hit is greater.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to ransomware, 13 percent had to cease trading entirely, and in one instance, people's lives were put at risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already fallen victim to attacks, and their patients were placed under serious threat as a result of the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell victims not to pay up: that simply exacerbates the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back.</seg>
<seg id="22">Faced with operations coming to a standstill, it is hard for managers to say no to the perpetrators' demands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And while private individuals are targeted for sums of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to bargain hard and pay out five-figure sums to get their files back decrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Faced with the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that three or four people will be involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware to the actual extortioners in the form of a set of software building blocks.</seg>
<seg id="30">Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and additional tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The kits include an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you just log into an underground forum, buy the set from a criminal, and task someone else with installing the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">There's a payment made for every computer infected.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Normally, criminals then task spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Now, many companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies' IT specialists in Maywarebytes' survey relied on using file back-ups and scanner software to beat ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">As a result, perpetrators are already trying out new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the risk potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of file.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand-new targets within the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the midst of winter, many victims would pay a ransom to have their blocked heating turned back on.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone's heating, ransomware could also be a issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Something for every situation</seg>
<seg id="2">HONDA HR-V is practical and perfect for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to cram everything into the small HR-V: a bit of an SUV, a bit of a coupé, bundled up with the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V, at just 1.60m tall, seems small, passengers in the front and the back have got plenty of room, it's not a squeeze at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials used in the interior are well crafted, and have a pleasant appearance - just the surface of the dashboard lets the side down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space.</seg>
<seg id="8">There isn't just a boot of 453 l with the seats up, and 1026 l with the seats down; there are the "magic seats" too.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is rather less magical than it sounds: the seats in the back can be flipped up like cinema seats to reveal additional loading space, measuring 1.24 m from floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a comparable model.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6 l diesel engine we tested, with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V powerfully, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km was pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is an additional motor: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 horsepower.</seg>
<seg id="15">All-wheel drive is not available.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its handling is balanced, a good compromise between speed and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering could be a bit more direct, however.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the top-flight "Executive" version, which we tested, the fittings leave nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include city emergency braking assistant (functions up to a speed of 32), collision warning system, and the lane departure warning system.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning system is irritating occasionally: when parking, it sees lots of obstacles as "approaching objects".</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant system is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator reacts to traffic signage, and reduces the vehicle's speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-range model: 7 inch touchscreen, satnav, app integration, and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are two USB ports and a HDMI port under the armrest, which makes them rather tricky to access.</seg>
<seg id="25">It costs around 29,000 euros for a top-of-the-range diesel model, which is fair.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest quite that much, the petrol model is available from 20,000 euros, and diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda is offering a diverse car that is perfect for everyday driving.</seg>

<seg id="2">An airline will not be liable for a passenger's fall on a passenger boarding bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel, the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).</seg>
<seg id="4">The claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was one of the ordinary risks of life, pronounced the court.</seg>

<seg id="1">When do organisers pay if illness strikes?</seg>
<seg id="2">Travellers who fall ill will only get their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of visitors can be proved to have suffered the same symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this case, a family were stricken with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="5">They spent almost all their holiday in their room.</seg>
<seg id="6">The holidaymakers blamed a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, which they believed to have polluted the seawater.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The claimants had no luck in court.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a fault.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the organiser only found out about this just before the claimants departed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Until that date, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the judgement, the organiser had not violated its information obligation.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, no contamination was found in water samples.</seg>

<seg id="1">De Maizière said that many people were worried about further attacks following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July.</seg>
<seg id="2">He said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resolve.</seg>
<seg id="3">One thing is for sure: Our country will not react to the perpetrators' violence with hatred and division.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will not give the terrorists this victory.</seg>
<seg id="5">If perpetrators have to leave the country quicker, that will boost security and increase the general public's approval of refugee politics.</seg>
<seg id="6">De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented before the federal elections in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also announced that security services would receive more staff, to the tune of "a mid-four figure sum over several years".</seg>
<seg id="8">Advertising for terrorism must be punishable once again.</seg>
<seg id="9">Video surveillance is to be improved, and gun laws to be amended so that purchasing weapons online, in particular, is made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="10">Doctors' confidentiality obligations, recently the subject of much discussion, are to remain, according to De Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, he wants to talk to doctors to find solutions to reduce the risk to the general public with regard to mental illness, he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Teachers must be better trained for dealing with traumatised individuals.</seg>
<seg id="14">De Maizière is planning to employ undercover agents to hunt down criminals in particular areas of the Internet (the Dark Web).</seg>
<seg id="15">SPD Head Gabriel said that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further".</seg>
<seg id="16">He said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That was a slap in the face for agitators in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel on Friday to the newspapers of the Funke media group.</seg>
<seg id="18">De Maizière had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road</seg>
<seg id="2">Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here's a photo from November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is about to change: the right-hand turning lane is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers stuck in rush-hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road (A43).</seg>
<seg id="5">Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the State Roadworks Office will extendthe right-hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Weseler Straße by 700 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The CDU fraction in the Münster (West) district administration came up with the idea to lengthen the exit.</seg>
<seg id="9">The traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second lane was removed a good eighteen months ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The relevant authorities cannot say how long this bottleneck, and the associated rush-hour traffic, will last.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's going to be a matter of years: officially, the bridge will remain in use until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">The district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right-hand turning lane, because it will cause delays.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="3">The "Nima's" association and Young Theatre are now planning a musical project.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "Nima's" association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="5">The "International Class" at the Kinderhaus forest school saw a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" at the Young Theatre in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within the framework of the "Intercultural Journey" set up by Nima's, 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house.</seg>
<seg id="7">The association's objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, and since the start of the year, it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most young people in the class arrived in Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thanks to the choreography, scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the plot regardless, according to the press release from Münster's Young Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre, will work on a musical theatre project together over the next season.</seg>
<seg id="11">From October to December, young people aged between 14 and 20 with and without a migrant and refugee background will have the chance to attend professionally-led courses for singing, dancing, acting, and music.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are also plans for acting and theatrical language training for children and families.</seg>

<seg id="1">Silent night: Tips to fight sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time morning comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they often or always wake up not feeling refreshed.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are various forms of sleep disorders, and they can have many causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What people generally understand by sleep disorders is insomnia: a problem with falling asleep and sleeping through the night.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Biological, psychological or behavioural factors can be to blame, along with medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">A sleep disorder is often a reflection of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Waking up very early is common with depression, in particular," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be the case that several factors have an impact on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you have a slipped disk, for example, you might find it hard to lie down, wake up every couple of hours, and start to grumble about everyday problems and worries, suggests Weeß as an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That causes tension, and it is impossible to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you see your doctor about sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If, over the course of a month, you sleep poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">They can impact in various different ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To be able to treat a sleep disorder, it is important to work out what is causing it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - with traditional sleeping tablets only being used in exceptional circumstances and for a maximum of two weeks - are all options for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result, you should first turn to your GP if you're suffering with a sleep disorder, recommends Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to a sleep lab, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">Doctors recommend an examination in a sleep lab for patients whose snoring disrupts their breathing, for people who feel abnormally sleepy during the day, for sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be pinpointed, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination at all.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just - please don't take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After being cabled up, you head to bed at your normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal cannula, a belt across your chest and a sensor on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sleeper.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experiencing?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a better night's sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching television to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex-teammates from criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle gets 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The remuneration system in swimming is poor, but doping tests, on the other hand, are very good, he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries who pay a lot and that don't pay as much attention to doping, or even encourage it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I'm not saying that we should stop our tests," he went on to explain.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to register with the National Anti-Doping Agency for Germany (NADA) nine months before he started.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be with countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of little linden trees, and a few cobblestones among them: at first glance, Berlin-Friedrichshain's Rigaer Straße doesn't look as if it's one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the street from east to west, you come across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is already underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles on this "trendy district", as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichshain, have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Berlin's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "no-go zone" for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared on 22 June by 300 police officers, the police patrolled the area for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three vans, closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">During this period, builders renovated the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, one day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were sitting on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Near the house project there is a primary school and a kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Far-left violence is not what worries most residents the most: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the district since 1999, and Jana*, who has brought three children up here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a district that wants more police protection against left-wing vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The schisms that Berlin's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up between the squatters in the house and their neighbours do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. Even today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including almost all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While those on Mainzerstraße were cleared out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become more and more of a magnet for tourists and Berlin residents who come from all over the world: residents from GDR times and former squatters are now sharing their district with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can be felt in the rents, which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Rigauer are seen as symbols of this development: this is clear from their broken windows or freshly painted facades splattered by paint bombs.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street has been mentioned so often this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by crime: according to statistics, almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a block of flats next-door to controversial number 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">She is calm about acts of violence: the people at number 94 are her neighbours, they certainly had nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the notorious burning cars have not played a role in Rigaer for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">The trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere".</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer chose to move to Rigauer Straße - and she chose to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is also why it was so important to her that residents got their street back: back from the police, politicians and the media who suddenly started claiming how important the district was in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away: by impersonal new developments in old empty sites, which drive out old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They are freehold flats, and most people here aren't interested in that - people here generally aren't so well-off," she said.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do when nobody listens to you?</seg>
<seg id="36">Then everyone gets frustrated, including the police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who have moved in and are irritated by paint bombs: The housing project and the left-wing scene are part of the district.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you move here, you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can't really complain about the noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deutscle is the new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deutschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She will also work on-site as a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She views herself as a point-of-contact for all involved: refugees, people from the working group for refugees, administrators, authorities, and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now available to work as a jack-of-all-trades to help anyone experiencing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's what some people said when management posted the advert for the job - meaning it less in a mocking way, and more with reference to the number of tasks that were to be performed.</seg>
<seg id="9">They were looking for a manager with people skills and communication skills, combined with years of experience in social work - a real jack-of-all-trades.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, managerial work is not how she spends most of her time, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is primarily about organisation, working on-site with people, even in the background, and networking, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in post for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has taken the 50% job for a fixed term of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was high time," Regine Kunde said, that Annika Deuschle offered support to voluntary and full-time workers.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are major problems, minor problems, organisational problems, problems with people, comprehension problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">For a while, one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status.</seg>
<seg id="18">Communes themselves are responsible for subsequent accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to house the refugees in their own properties or in rented properties.</seg>
<seg id="20">Communes themselves have to bear the costs for constructing, renting or renovating this accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility switches from district administration to communes and job centres.</seg>
<seg id="22">The problem: Properties are free, but not every landlord is prepared to let.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration cannot find any private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to Deuschle, being reliant on private homes has not worked.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is why the commune's homes need to be beefed up, as it is so neatly put.</seg>
<seg id="27">Consequently new containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But homes alone will not do the trick.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the key word, and Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree on that score.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed abode, internships, apprenticeships, school places, "one-euro" traineeship jobs and temporary jobs need to be found or set up for refugees and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More jobs would be good," reports Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many people work in builder's yards or help caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive public perception.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is not "employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Being active doesn't just mean working.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and Kunde say.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">Consequently there is a need to provide sports, contact to locals, and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">There is where the administration and volunteers can get involved.</seg>
<seg id="41">She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The length of time that processes take is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All told, this is "a mammoth task".</seg>
<seg id="48">A tricky question: After recent events, are the two women worried about radicalisation, even in a small commune like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," Regine Kunde said clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, volunteers are already aware of this.</seg>
<seg id="51">These issues are already discussed by the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," Regine Kunde said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many of them would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So full-time and volunteer staff have to keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">But they always have in the back of their mind that a new group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">Politicians shy away from answering this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is unfair to show them volunteers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," said Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">The situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Kunde also makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, you've got to help them - and both women agree on that.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A mental asylum, where today young people are said to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where they are now digging tunnels for the S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="4">Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich brings captivating stories to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas, an offering from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date – and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when one compares them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital BayernAtlas is a patchwork quilt that one doesn't quite recognise for what it is at first.</seg>
<seg id="12">Within the large overview map, were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called original-lay-of-the-land sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority, these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their commissioner: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800, during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey – naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally retreated with the Treaty of Lunéville from 9th February 1801: it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph propelled the project further forward, founding the "Topographical Bureau" – and with that, the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original lay-of-the-land sheet for Munich originates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of past/present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has stretched out in all directions and coalesced.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">Around 1856, Untersendling's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers' revolt against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but field – at first sight: upon zooming in, a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record", from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there – rather, it is allotment holders of the "Land in Sonne" facility.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still actually a "Wiese" – a meadow – and not a concrete wasteland.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the original lay-of-the-land sheet, in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is, one can make out not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "Auf der Lüften" – but can actually read in large letters "mental asylum".</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, they once imprisoned people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" had come to life there in 1858/59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution – the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men.</seg>
<seg id="36">What is more, he forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been busying itself for an exhibition with the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Originally there was place for 280 patients; later this was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point even this capacity was no longer enough – the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Clinic, East Munich, has been located there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatric units in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the plot of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, and to the east, residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" nursery was built – in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">Marienplatz was recorded as the "main square" in around 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big one remains up to this day – at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small commercial premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood in the Marienhof, where these days, preparations for the second S-Bahn main line are underway, with first digging to follow on 5th April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">You can use the slider control to compare the old Munich map with the aerial view from today – and to fill in the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>

<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pasture fence project is fundamental</seg>
<seg id="2">The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view.</seg>
<seg id="4">Representatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm, belonging to the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="5">To start with, Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of pasture and 40 hectares of woodland, keeps 40 milk cows and just as many young stock, and accommodates five apartments of holiday makers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Schwendemann says that, for him, there is no alternative to the "Black Forest milk" marketing channel he uses for the milk from his cows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only regional produce is served to the holiday-makers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "fundamentally important".</seg>
<seg id="9">I can't make a profit on that kind of steep-sloping ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grassland areas make for a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the string trimmer.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We have to grapple with the conditions and with the topography here," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2003, he took over his parents' business and he manages this without chemical crop protection and fertilisers, even if it's not an organic farm that he's running.</seg>
<seg id="13">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the community has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy to have the Leader funding".</seg>
<seg id="14">The farmers need support to the tune of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="15">One hopes that with that, afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="17">The farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding.</seg>
<seg id="18">Using the pasture fence funding, a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced off in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="19">The areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of the total costs, to the tune of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="21">The farmers were thus left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in the 16.2-kilometre pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job. Without farmers we'd not be able to function."</seg>
<seg id="24">Peter Weiß is also standing firm: "First-class foodstuffs are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation (LPR) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible.</seg>
<seg id="26">Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="27">A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, the fenced-off area is not allowed to be farmable with a tractor (gradient of over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project, an application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build just shy of 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="30">The areas of land to be kept open equate to 35 hectares; the calculated costs amount to more than 112,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="45">Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="46">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a great showcase for this course."</seg>
<seg id="9">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a wonderful place to play golf in.</seg>
<seg id="14">The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.</seg>

<seg id="16">Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm happy with how it's going so far."</seg>
<seg id="22">Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.</seg>

<seg id="3">This is the conclusion drawn by scientists from the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.</seg>

<seg id="5">For comparison, he referred to one of his own studies on this topic from 1994.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>
<seg id="135">Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="136">"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.</seg>
<seg id="137">"What else could we do?"</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="2">The president of the International Tennis Federation has failed with his big Davis Cup coup in the general assembly.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the (for this sport) revolutionary suggestion to from now on play the Davis Cup singles over only best-of-three sets received just shy – by a whisker – of the necessary two-thirds majority in support.</seg>
<seg id="4">The admittedly often very long, but for that reason also greatly treasured, five-set classics are therefore surviving in the traditional competition.</seg>
<seg id="5">63.54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform; ITF president David Haggerty's objective was therefore only just missed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We respect the decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.</seg>
<seg id="7">We need change in order to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition," said Haggerty.</seg>
<seg id="8">There will continue to be work done to improve the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">After many objections beforehand already, the suggestion to hold the final at a neutral location did not even make it to the vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: so, in future, the finalists of the David Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year.</seg>

<seg id="2">A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.</seg>
<seg id="3">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="2">Electronics-multi-talent Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".</seg>
<seg id="3">Up until now, he has withheld the fact that a portion of these customers have already cancelled their non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alongside the always triumphant figures for sales increases and the even more gigantic sales targets, with the announcement of the most recent quarterly financial statement, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time had to reveal another, less glamorous number: that of the cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent months, Musk had frequently used those more than 500,000 pre-orders to talk up the new car, for which distribution is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Musk now concedes that of the 518,000 total pre-orders, 63,000 have already been retracted.</seg>
<seg id="7">Critics had time and again pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="8">In cases of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000-euro (in the USA, 1000-US-dollar, and in Great Britain, 1000-pound) "reservation deposit" back in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, conceded Musk in a conference call with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="11">His argument: The challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2018 – all models taken together – it is said to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demand is therefore clearly there.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Musk, a further 1800 reservations arrive each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – that's if Tesla manages to get its brand-spanking new production lines going, as of yet never tested in practice, without any major interruptions and at maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many experts doubt whether that's possible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should there be major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the company cannot then prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="1">Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="2">750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, invitations are being issued to a serenade in the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="3">Due to its idyllic setting and beautiful view over the village, the historical site of St. Hilarius is a beloved place to tarry a while.</seg>
<seg id="4">Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area their concern.</seg>
<seg id="6">Walter Martini stresses: "It is a one-of-a-kind rural jewel".</seg>
<seg id="7">The St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in records in 1267 in the Württemberg register: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church for Tumlingen on it, together with the Bailiwick" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the text of the official document, aside from the former parish church, a lordly farm also stood on the Tumlingen mountain, which itself owned the church, or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="9">People therefore also lived there too.</seg>
<seg id="10">As is apparent from the upper administrative office for Freudenstadt's description in 1858, the "mountain" was, alongside the lower village and the upper village that can just about be made out still in the appearance of Tumlingen today, the village's third, grand centre of settlement.</seg>
<seg id="11">All maps from the time of around 1600 substantiate this historical reality.</seg>
<seg id="12">The right of patronage arose out of the Early Middle-Age proprietary church law.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lord who built and furnished a church and staffed it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequeath this proprietary church right.</seg>
<seg id="14">Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or nominate a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="16">The larger of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="17">The newly acquired bell then first chimed in 1692, but had to later be surrendered in the Second World War, in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the 30 Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes stolen.</seg>
<seg id="19">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 1796, French troops made camp in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="21">They brought out the pulpit and the pews and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="22">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="23">Up until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen served as the last place of rest for Hörschweiler's dead.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="25">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="26">On new year's eve of 1834, a storm cleaved the church tower and half of it collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to prevent an accident, the tower was pulled down.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only the dwarf tower that is still present today survived as witness of the church's 750-year-old history.</seg>
<seg id="29">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Industrious Pensioners" care for the Hilarius site, as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="30">As event organiser, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen are issuing invitations to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel, on Sunday 16th July.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is being arranged by the Kepler Gymnasium, Freudenstadt, combo, with speeches from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="32">Municipal administrator Hartmut Romann gave the closing words.</seg>
<seg id="33">The programme starts at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last admission is at 3.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="35">The serenade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Enjoy a summer's evening under the shadows of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows right up to forest," invite the organisers, emphasising the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="37">The serenade will only take place in the case of dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="38">The organisers are hoping for many backers in favour of preserving the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to Tumlingen and to Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen feel especially bound to take care of their local region, as serenade organiser Walter Martini reinforced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Association wants to have wind turbine approval examined</seg>
<seg id="2">"Boisheim wehrt sich", sees no legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the District Administrator.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to retract his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="4">They say it was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="5">The association argues that at the time the approval was given on 30th December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in Bosheimer Nette, since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Viersen, on the city boundary with Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such zones are said to prevent "asparagusisation" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city of Viersen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, through an amendment to the local land-use plan – but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to the lack of legal planning requirements, the approval decision that was issued is still unlawful, and should therefore be retracted as well," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".</seg>
<seg id="10">The current state of affairs: the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the regional government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="11">Erkens: "Grant of approval for the construction of wind turbines on this site is therefore precluded by planning law."</seg>
<seg id="12">The district confirms receipt of the call for action.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The relevant correspondence was received by the district of Viersen in the last week," declared a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The district is taking it as a reason to investigate the matter afresh.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="16">With a view to the proceedings underway at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".</seg>
<seg id="17">NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a plot by Bosheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company, in which the city of Viersen holds indirect participating interests, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site last year already.</seg>
<seg id="19">The construction of the four wind turbines should cover the energy requirements of around 11,400 households – that equates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Viersen households.</seg>
<seg id="20">NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">Last summer, Viersen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Übachpalenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Town and dealers plan "hometown shopping" weekend</seg>
<seg id="2">Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The trade association and town authorities want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th September to entice residents to a shopping spree in the town centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "home-town shopping" weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="5">A market with local suppliers is thus planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, homegrown companies are to give showcases, with their apprenticeship places.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, the businesses in the town centre are to invite people to come "midnight shopping".</seg>
<seg id="8">The campaign is not only for residents of the town and the nearby region.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adverts on the radio, an online video and printed bags that allude to the campaign weekend are in preparation, Christian König tells us.</seg>
<seg id="10">Town authorities and the trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="11">The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the "attractive town centre" project.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this belong new offerings such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival along with Sunday trading, talks with all the traders and proprietors to induce people to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Attractive offers on the Saturday and waiving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, new and existing customer bases can be developed.</seg>
<seg id="15">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="16">But many locals too had lost sight of the town centre for shopping.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ultimately, it all has to contribute to breathing life into the town centre – right up to landlords, businesses across the whole town and associations.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to overcome the lethargy with a network that has partly built up, König had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brigit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in Mühlhausen communicated that five Thüringen towns are taking part in the nation's third "hometown shopping" day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alongside Bad Lagensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="21">The day is intended to "promote appreciation for local trade and emphasise more strongly its importance for the common good of our towns," said Streich.</seg>
<seg id="22">The campaign, under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="2">In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf again focusses on a colourful and frivolous production, set against a giant, six-storey backdrop.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner, complete with remains of the Wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the DDR times, or the New York stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front is parked an open vintage Mercedes car, in which the Rhinemaidens pose like rocker girls, or alternatively, an Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif – gold, power and greed – that runs through his production of the "Ring".</seg>
<seg id="6">The three Rhinemaidens – sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner – work wonderfully together, as they did already in "Rheingold".</seg>
<seg id="7">They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), lug a body in the boot in Hollywood manner, and play the riotous clique.</seg>
<seg id="8">Stephen Milling sings the part of the superbly nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The scene where he slays Siegfried is brutal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) cops it too.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audience thanks the ensemble with mighty applause.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a rapturous reception for Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who effaces himself and bows his hands, forming a Merkel diamond.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is huge applause for the Festival Orchestra, who appear on stage for the first time – in casual leisurewear in view of the high heat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The performance from Frank Castorf and his directing team had been awaited with excitement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if in 2013 he had had to endure another hall full of shrill catcalls, five years later there were great cheers, which drowned out the isolated boos.</seg>
<seg id="16">Festival head Katharina Wagner will likely have been delighted.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once can see that the audience has in some way grown into the "Ring"," she had said shortly before the performance from the dpa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The audience has not only made a kind of peace with Castorf, but on top of that, an understanding for his point of view has grown.</seg>
<seg id="19">I see positive results.</seg>

<seg id="12">And then I successfully abandoned, shall we say, a civil engineering course of studies.</seg>
<seg id="13">I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="14">And then I asked myself, what do you do?</seg>
<seg id="15">Do a social year, you can get an insight, can see what it is really like on site, in the thick of things too perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="16">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="17">Menge: I gathered great insights.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="20">Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service?</seg>
<seg id="21">Menge: Yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="22">It always depends on where one is doing their voluntary service year.</seg>
<seg id="23">One can do it from at the old people's home right up to in youth work – in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my case, it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="25">I was also sometimes at the open full-day schools, that is, for the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me that was exactly the right thing, the thing that got me fired up.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was able to recognise and see my own strengths, as it was really happening.</seg>
<seg id="28">Differently from when doing the civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="29">Menge: Yeah, sure; here it's not about working out statistics.</seg>
<seg id="30">One always has other people at the front of their minds, people who all have totally different histories behind them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Whether it's a refugee or an adolescent who has been pulled out of their family – you always have to approach it individually.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1">Municipal council wants common room</seg>
<seg id="2">In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln passed a resolution for a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ahead of the debate, there is an important piece of information to be had: the purchase contract for the as yet still needed plot section has been signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="4">Admittedly it will still be a while until the plot, which up until now has belonged to the church parish, comes into the possession of the municipality, but nevertheless, there are now no longer any planning obstacles for the project that has to be materialised by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why there is a debate concerning a common room.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of the two investors that are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="7">For a special price, it would provide a living space – of around 55 square metres – and an adjacent terrace with no less than 70 square metres on the ground floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">What the management and the majority of the municipal council have in mind is not simply to set aside such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior citizens' accommodation, but for it to be open to the community.</seg>
<seg id="9">Talk of a "knitting café" was making the rounds, for example.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decision, which was already pre-determined last Autumn through the allocation of resources for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The building is in an area for redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="12">The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support, reports Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">So as to signal to the investor that no-one wants to put a spoke in their wheel, the proposed resolution makes allowances for the determination that both a saddled roof – based on the surrounding buildings – and a mono-pitch roof – which reduces the height of the eaves and makes the building more economical – would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">An uneccessary addition, thinks not only Wilfried Sohmer.</seg>
<seg id="15">If it helps: it passes through the committee unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's not so easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="17">Daniela Ruf points to their many owned buildings that are not really being forged ahead, but instead they are going out of their way with the common room: "I have difficulty with that," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yvonne Staiger declares herself to be unequivocally in favour of the common room – but absolutely against an investment from the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="19">She views that as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy, or even foreign, investors.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is simply not true according to the counterargument, for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants, but are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value.</seg>
<seg id="21">Staiger's proposal, to split up the proposed resolution accordingly, has three supporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, with two dissenting votes, they are sticking with the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up as follows: "If we pass the resolution as so, we make a huge step towards plugging a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="1">Wandering from star to star in the Harz</seg>
<seg id="2">The nation's first "astral path" is to come to life in the Harz.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory society.</seg>
<seg id="4">There has been a planetary trail in Göttingen since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">An "astral path" satisfies many Harz visitors' need for information, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members want to set up plaques along the planned route and put information about stars and constellations on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a first phase, until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the running are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="10">The information on the plaques is to be expanded upon online.</seg>
<seg id="11">So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The astral path is later to be extended, step by step.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Spectators will gain lots of useful knowledge on the astral path, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the society.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, they will learn why stars have different colours, or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is significantly further away.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will also teach which constellation a selected star is located in, and when the best time to see it is.</seg>
<seg id="17">The society has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany, in the small mountain town of St. Andreasberg, since 2014 already.</seg>
<seg id="18">The location in the middle of the Harz national park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">One can regularly clearly see the Milky Way, and even the Andromeda Galaxy, from there with naked eyes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The university town, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium friends' association, has had something similar to the astral path since 2013 – the planetary trail.</seg>
<seg id="21">Starting at Gebhards Hotel in Goethealle, which forms the centre of our solar system, the planetary trail leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the observatory – as well as an "extra-terrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.</seg>
<seg id="22">The steles with the individual planets – including Pluto, which was downgraded to a dwarf planet, at the end point – are set up at exact intervals and on a scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Earth thus shrinks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="24">The total distance covered by the planetary trail is a good four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="25">While the light of the sun needs around eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.</seg>
<seg id="26">So, pedestrians are faster than light in space.</seg>
<seg id="27">The trek to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown</seg>
<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="1">Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three at the back works better"</seg>
<seg id="2">Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to kick off the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points in Aue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Andre Hoffmann was content with the first game of the season, and with the result too, were it not for the two own goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That was two own goals too many, and in Aue, we have to take better care still," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.</seg>
<seg id="5">The line of three at the back is to be optimised even further in the Ore mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the Fortunas don't want to let in any more goals after free kicks either.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In future, no-one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing) any more."</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoffmann is convinced that his team manages better with the three-at-the-back formation, even after the experiences in the build-up.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue," said the coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoachmann is sure of himself, "because in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well," said Hoffmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, a prerequisite is that we harmonise even better together and don't commit so many passing errors in the build up."</seg>
<seg id="11">Naturally, Hoffmann is also travelling to Aue to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Whether after one draw though one can talk of a failed start, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="13">The performance could by all means be okay," said Hoffmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">"However, if we're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season kick-off."</seg>
<seg id="15">His coach didn't want to hear any of that.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony team's game in Heidenhelm had to be cut-off early due to a storm.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Now they are effectively able to start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffman believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be somewhat fresher, since they don't have any difficult and full games like Fortuna against one of the promotion favourites resting in their bones.</seg>
<seg id="18">"But they don't know 100 per cent where they stand at the moment," says the Fortuna central defender.</seg>
<seg id="19">Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished Aue stadium as slight favourites.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That we are going to sweep them away just because we can claim a place amongst the top six is ridiculous," says Funkel, whose balance sheet against Aue, with only one defeat in nine games, is thoroughly positive.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that one has to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.</seg>
<seg id="22">"To give such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous."</seg>
<seg id="23">And Funkel does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="1">Right on target</seg>
<seg id="2">The works on the three bridges of the L 108 road, between Lauterbach and Schramberg, are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We're doing very well for time – it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government.</seg>
<seg id="5">In April, works began on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The works are scheduled to be completed in October, and Leicht is certain that the timetable will be stuck to.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete that is covered in red variegated sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like the other two bridges, it is old by now.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to ensure their stability and road safety, the three structures now have to be thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="12">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are made of variegated sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both were erected in 1939 and they are twelve and 10.60 metres high, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now – as of Wednesday morning – been given a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne-heavy so-called bridge parapet on its north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This fixes the boundary and is also used as a passenger path.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2.20-metre-wide bridge parapet is to be put in place on the south part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="18">The pedestrian walkway is intended to then to run over that.</seg>
<seg id="19">What is special about this is that is uses finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="20">The other two bridges are already kitted out with the patented bridge parapets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach required particular flair.</seg>
<seg id="22">For a fibreglass cable also runs there, which many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the run-up to the works, residents were informed about the project via a leaflet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fish and crabs must also be fished out first.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the bridges between the construction yard building and the lake reservoir in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane and regulated by lights.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge, where the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels are, is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Altogether, the costs for the three bridge renovations total 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="28">The entire project is being funded by the state.</seg>

<seg id="2">It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany (AfD), people come together who would otherwise be difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="3">The parties who represent in the Vulkan Eifel district council (CDU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, FWG, die Linke) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully nailing its colours to the mast on this day because the AfD are holding a "big kick-off to the election campaign" in Gerolstein Town Hall plaza.</seg>
<seg id="4">And are launching famous names – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland makes up the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24th September, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch.</seg>
<seg id="5">But those who have been on site for hours already before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD, but rather, demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="6">The motto: "Eifel is staying colourful."</seg>
<seg id="7">Originally the town picnic was planned for Brunnenplatz square under the motto "everyone at one table", but now is taking place in the carpark beneath the shopping plaza – and therefore directly in sight of those coming to the AfD event in the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="8">A colourful picture on show there.</seg>
<seg id="9">And what really delighted Christa Karoli, chairperson of the Eine Welt (One World) Forum and one of the leading organisers: "It's great how many people have come together here."</seg>
<seg id="10">There's music and all sorts of food, including a "typical German potato salad" that even the AfD would have no problem eating," said the woman who had brought it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police had summoned lots of officials to Gerolstein and were above all also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event locations.</seg>
<seg id="12">How did the AfD make it to Gerolstein, actually?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mario Hompe from the Vulkan Eifel AfD reports that he strove hard to get such an event and that he won the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 45-year-old from Gönndersdorf had originally inquired in Daun, but had got a no there because there were not enough parking places available due to the St. Lawrence funfair already being set up.</seg>
<seg id="15">So now, the shopping plaza; Hompes is delighted that "we are able to hold such a wonderful event here".</seg>
<seg id="16">With a view to the event on the plaza forecourt he says: "It's the people's right. The main this is that it stays peaceful".</seg>
<seg id="17">And it does: at around 8pm some entertainment is provided, by a band on the plaza forecourt, and in the town hall, by various speakers, including Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the hall there are about 200 in attendance, waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch, to give their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="19">The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials have had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour; the guests in the forecourt have a long wind, but even there it is time to clear up shortly after 9pm.</seg>
<seg id="21">The police can go away – no specific incidents.</seg>

<seg id="5">So, Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both have in common a passion not only for transcending the boundaries of their instruments but also for conflating the boundaries of the various genres.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, Johann Sebastian Bach played by the two of them takes on a whole new sound, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suits" from JazzEcho prize-winner Nils Wogram, they blend classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating complete art work.</seg>

<seg id="4">"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."</seg>
<seg id="5">The rally erupted in cheers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's worth about $1.59 billion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali</seg>
<seg id="2">At a memorial service in the north Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people commemorated both soldiers who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Mali.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precautions.</seg>
<seg id="4">German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) remained silent on the as-yet-unexplained cause of the crash.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, she described the two pilots who were killed as "experts in their field".</seg>
<seg id="6">"We bow before this greatest of sacrifices that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from north Hessen lost their lives a week ago, on Wednesday, in the West African country of Mali.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their coffins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter's cathedral in Fritzlar, accompanied by a wake from the German army.</seg>
<seg id="9">At midday, the relatives first said their goodbyes in the church.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, amidst family and closest friends, the memorial service was begun by representatives of the German Army and the political world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among these were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Inspector General of the German Army, Volker Wieker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Memorial guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.</seg>
<seg id="13">The people of Fritzlar and numerous soldier followed the ceremony in front of the church on a big screen.</seg>
<seg id="14">Defence minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Stabshauptmann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots in his regiment.</seg>
<seg id="16">Volker Bauersachs too, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew were not able to prevent the crash, then no-one could have".</seg>
<seg id="17">Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two nations," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the memorial service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Germany Army did not wish to give any indications about when or where they are to be buried.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife</seg>
<seg id="2">The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prinz Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.</seg>
<seg id="3">The royal family shared that on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are interred in Roskilde Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="5">The sculptor Bildhauer Bjørn Nørgaard is already crafting a sarcophagus for the two of them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The queen is content with her husband's decision, the announcement continued.</seg>
<seg id="7">Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prinz Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.</seg>
<seg id="10">After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2016, he went into retirement and at the same time also laid aside his title of "Prince Consort".</seg>
<seg id="12">Since Henrik did not get the title and function that he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife – not after death either, explains Lene Balleby, chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.</seg>
<seg id="13">Where the last place of rest will be in the end for the 83-year-old is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland, but rather in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="15">He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="16">Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a noble French family, he had got to know Margrethe in 1965 in London.</seg>
<seg id="17">He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Whereas the people's expressions of sympathy always flew to his then to be wife, Prinz Henrik had a hard time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.</seg>
<seg id="19">In an autobiography, Henrik commented on his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything that I did was criticised.</seg>
<seg id="20">My Danish was faltering, I preferred wine to beer, silk socks to wool socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco, and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellectuals who were critical of society, I could not hope for any leniency.</seg>
<seg id="22">I was different.</seg>
<seg id="23">It seemed I was happy with this position and not ashamed of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those were two errors!"</seg>

<seg id="1">Prime Minister Weil wants a snap new election</seg>
<seg id="2">CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony</seg>
<seg id="3">Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) wants the State Parliament to have a snap new election after the loss of the red-green governing majority – but he doesn't want to step down.</seg>
<seg id="4">Weil declared himself on Friday to be in favour of a dissolution of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Previously, the unexpected resignation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s government into a stark crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition lost in Hanover, and with that, their scant one-vote majority in Parliament over the opposition of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="7">Elke Twesten, up until that point a Green Party representative, justified her move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).</seg>
<seg id="8">"I see my political future in the CDU," she stated on Friday in Hanover.</seg>
<seg id="9">CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his party to take her in.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the CDU and the FDP would together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament, and the Greens, 68 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">Up until now, that ratio was the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new State Parliament will be elected as normal on the 14th January next year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thümler says that the red-green State Government now has to decide whether it can continue to govern in these circumstances without a majority.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Stephan Weil considers it imperative that the State Parliament vote to dissolve itself as swiftly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how they will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="16">The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament declares no confidence in the Prime Minister and elects a successor.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Our constitution offers various options.</seg>
<seg id="18">The possibilities have to be examined in a proper legal way," said Thümler.</seg>
<seg id="19">"All aspects will be debated in good time, if they are examined in a sound legal way."</seg>
<seg id="20">Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious though".</seg>
<seg id="21">The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="22">I feel very good."</seg>
<seg id="23">She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Greens called on the defecting representative to give up her seat in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament, which she won on a Green party ticket, with immediate effect," communicated state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Green Party chairwoman Anja Piel said: "We exceedingly regret Elke Twesten's decision".</seg>
<seg id="27">She consciously decided not to give any statement in the parliamentary group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Especially given the background, that there were no essential differences – we can't understand this move."</seg>
<seg id="29">SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz denounced the crossing over of Lower Saxony Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="30">"The behaviour of the former Green representative in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal to red-green," wrote the Social Democratic federal leader on Friday on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="31">He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s decision to let the State Parliament have new elections soon.</seg>
<seg id="32">Twesten's resignation costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="33">The politician "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration" put "her personal interests above the wellbeing of the state," critisised SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony plays along in this dirty scheming and attempts to score political points from it."</seg>
<seg id="35">Lower Saxony CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his representatives to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="36">The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Opperman, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career notions.</seg>
<seg id="37">The CDU was then the strongest power ahead of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament.</seg>

<seg id="1">Minister of Agriculture in interview – How do we protect ourselves against poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt?</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.</seg>
<seg id="3">How was it possible for the scandal to happen?</seg>
<seg id="4">How can consumers protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="5">Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers our questions in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="7">I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the stamps printed on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The federal states are each supplying their most up-to-date information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de.</seg>
<seg id="9">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even if, according to everything we know at this point in time, a health risk is all but ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is Aldi now adopting the best possible reaction to the crisis – removing all eggs from their offering – because the Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture is not really playing the central role of providing clear information?</seg>
<seg id="12">Monitoring foodstuffs is a task for the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite that, the ministry immediately connected and has been liaising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected.</seg>
<seg id="14">All information and the risk assessment are accessible to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is up to the trade just as much as it is the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold meet trading requirements and do not present any health risks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For eggs, if the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded, then they do not meet trading requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="18">This time the businesses are not at fault.</seg>
<seg id="19">Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="20">According to what we currently know, the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, due to suspected illegal practices by service companies, they have to deal with commercial claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">As always in emergencies, there are too few inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it just the number of staff that is lacking, or the key competence as well?</seg>
<seg id="24">It was actually the official controls themselves that exposed what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, we must also remember that food fraud and criminal activity can never be 100% eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is for precisely this reason that it is so crucially important to have such occurrences thoroughly cleared up and passed over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes could have committed.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have already made it clear many times that I am expecting a complete resolution from the authorities in charge.</seg>
<seg id="28">Is the alarmism that regularly arises with food scandals really necessary?</seg>
<seg id="29">Consumers have the right to get only safe food that is approved for market.</seg>
<seg id="30">If a prohibited insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are quite right to be indignant.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to these adulterated products, manufacturers, retailers and consumers get into a situation that is entirely unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fundamentally the following has to be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately.</seg>
<seg id="33">Work must be done on this consistently and urgently at all levels.</seg>
<seg id="34">I expect all responsible authorities to clear up the matter swiftly and completely.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="2">In the last few years, Chocolat Frey has made on-board chocolates for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: the airline is inviting new calls for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, in response to a query from news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">The products would be reviewed and undergo a quality control every two to three years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every year, around 17 million small 14-gram chocolate bars packaged in red and white are handed out by the flight attendants to passengers before landing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to "Nordwestschweiz", industry insiders estimate the order volumes to be 1.5 to 2 million francs – the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, more important is always the advertising effect: for a chocolate producer, it is a prestigious contract.</seg>
<seg id="12">Swiss will not disclose how many bidders there are for the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, only Swiss producers are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">The biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available to the sda for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Swiss has been handing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="17">Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate bars, in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="18">Swiss introduced the possibility of inserting a logo two and a half years ago, at the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="19">The airline collaborates with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="20">On long-haul flights, the first class customers are spoiled with treats from confectioner Sprüngli; in business class, passengers nibble on chocolate from Lindt, and in economy class, chocolate from Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="21">On short-haul routes too, Swiss hands out chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in business and in economy class.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blow dealt to drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="2">The police have delivered a successful blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, numerous properties were searched in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, said the Konstanz public prosecutor's office on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the course of this, 15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, were detained and already had arrest warrants issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="6">At simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were detained.</seg>
<seg id="7">German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both of them were therefore presumably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">In total, over 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The mafia members were charged with organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already.</seg>
<seg id="13">There was an active exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators from Rottweil CID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="14">The major operation on Wednesday morning was thus attended by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="15">The investigations then turned their sights above all to Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="16">An incident on 27th May in Hüfingen, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to have been caused by the gang.</seg>

<seg id="1">Weise complains of big holes in the Register of Foreign Nationals</seg>
<seg id="2">"Data for citizens that ought not to be showing up there": according to a report, the Register of Foreigner Nationals in Germany is exhibiting significant defects.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is leading to some grave mistakes in decisions within asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frank-Jürgen Weise, the official appointee of the German Government for the management of refugees, has brought attention to big holes in the Central Register of Foreign Nationals, according to one media report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Defects in the data registered there could lead to "some grave mistakes in decisions" when it comes to asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis received by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to that information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, among whom around 5.7 million from non-EU states.</seg>
<seg id="7">The data are managed by around 600 Foreigners' Registration Offices in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained, it said, the quality of the data has in part not been good to date.</seg>
<seg id="9">In some cases, data from 1921 was found, "from people who have long been dead, or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Erroneous data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, within the statistics on those people who are obliged to leave the country are recorded EU citizens, who do not at all have to leave.</seg>
<seg id="12">Such false categorisations, however, led to "a biased debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave the country," it says accordingly in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the German Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 years of age, if this is where they entered the country from.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".</seg>
<seg id="15">In the paper, it says that the BAMF has been once more transacting such procedures "that concern families with children – with the exception of infants and very small children – to Italy since 1st June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the end of 2014, that had practically no longer been possible, says the newspaper, pointing to the difficult situation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Dublin Regulation, it is the EU state the refugee first reaches that is responsible for them.</seg>
<seg id="18">If a migrant travels further into another EU country, this state can send him back to the country he entered from.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a means of justification, the office writes: "By now, the intake capacity for families with children who are minors has significantly increased in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="20">Italy has provided guarantees for the intake and accommodation of families.</seg>
<seg id="21">The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself considers these pledges to be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other EU states too would send back refugees there using the scope of the Dublin Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Linke party's spokeswoman for domestic poicy, Ulla Elpke, criticised this decision: "Due to shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with conditions of admission that contravene human rights and with risk to the child's welfare"</seg>

<seg id="2">Altogether, the blood donor service made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for others.</seg>
<seg id="3">At least, from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ahead of everyone is Jürgen Greule, who has by now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The community traditionally acknowledges the repeated willingness to give blood in the meeting of its municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for strangers, and so selflessly," stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner.</seg>
<seg id="7">"One single blood donation helps multiple people," explained the district head of the on-call service of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the reserves are broken down into their components.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, as many as three people could benefit from a single blood donation.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This year, we achieved our second best result ever, with 114 donors," said the DRK on-call district head.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obviously the move into the theatre venue a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already before then, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were numbered amongst the repeat donors and honoured for having made 50 donations each.</seg>
<seg id="13">Half as many were clocked up by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Reixinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brothers fight over $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."</seg>
<seg id="32">On Friday, that hope appeared gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>

<seg id="1">Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Hotel Birkenhof is being turned into the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="3">The house just outside Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and should be opened again on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">For when the Hotel Birkenhof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014, at the time around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, and with that, the income from the visitors' taxes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing, which sparked controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision passed in the municipal council back then without controversy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet Freudenstadt's lord mayor, Julian Osswald, in particular, defended the hotel location and already back then spoke of serious interested parties in the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">And he was right.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Luisenhotels Group, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three-stars-or-more category, under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="12">The group has four establishments including the Freudenstadt property.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two of them are in Bad Bergzabern, and one is in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and, now, Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has been a skip standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear just how extensive the refurbishment works are that are being undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="16">The floors have been ripped out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bath tubs taken out of the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The entire hotel building is one big construction site.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is still a lot to do before March.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is truly a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our paper.</seg>
<seg id="20">Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="21">The rooms are being kitted out with large, walk-in showers, the entrance foyer is being revamped, new windows are being installed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything should later become "beautifully in touch with the people", is how Thomas Scherer expressed it.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We want to make a gem of it."</seg>
<seg id="24">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="25">One doesn't want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but still at an elevated downtown level, stressed Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Waldhotel Luise, with its roughly 60 rooms, wants to set itself up for a broad audience, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="27">Individual holiday-makers, groups, and business people, should all feel at home in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scherer said that he had already had conversations with Lord Mayor Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause.</seg>
<seg id="29">The city's expectations are said to be in line with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We're on the same page."</seg>
<seg id="31">Asked about the level of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to commit himself precisely.</seg>
<seg id="32">A little under a million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outside facilities are also being revamped – that can already be seen.</seg>
<seg id="34">In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is taking shape, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia affair: US Special Counsel convenes grand jury</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have convened a so-called grand jury, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", relying on sources intimately acquainted with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper judged the step to be a sign that Mueller has broadened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The broadcaster CNN reported that the panel has already issued its first subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="6">US secret service has long been accusing the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several men who acted as Republican advisers during the election campaign are said to stand at the centre of the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to reports, Mueller has been subjecting Trump's private and business circles to more and more scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="10">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally shifted the centre of focus onto Trump and is investigating the charge of whether or not the President could have obstructed the course of justice during the affair.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the main task of the grand jury to review the available evidence in cases of possible felonies and to decide whether charges should be brought.</seg>
<seg id="12">Grand juries are for this reason also called prosecution chambers.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are usually engaged for major and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The panel may also be engaged by the public prosecutor's office to subpoena people for questioning under oath.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued in relation to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="17">People who had been involved in this meeting had been summoned to give evidence, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were also supposed to make documents available.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the convening shows that Mueller will not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly, should that be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nevertheless, the convening of the panel signals the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and gives President Trump a new cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the midst of these new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Russia story is a total fabrication," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said the subject gives Democrats an opportunity "to feel better when they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="26">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the convening of a grand jury.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it usually operates in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Counsel in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="29">Former head of the FBI James Comey said three times that the President was not under investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is no reason to presume that anything has changed, his statement continued.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, Mueller was only engaged after Trump had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the sacking, accusations were raised that he wanted to obstruct the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="33">Comey stated before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to put an end to the investigations into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="34">The President was under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="35">As the US media portrays it, the White House gathered materials against the Special Counsel and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="36">This gave rise to speculations about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unlike an independent Special Counsel of Congress, such as, for example, in the Watergate scandal concerning President Richard Nixon, who later stepped down, Mueller is in a position where, in theory, he could be fired by the justice department if the President pushed for it.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, various senators, from both parties, want to avoid such a move.</seg>
<seg id="39">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Counsel to be dismissed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts into the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="2">In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven communicated this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The over a trillion-ton-heavy and 5800-square-kilometre-big colossus is now drifting to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt.</seg>
<seg id="5">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="6">It does not pose any danger for men.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the iceberg breaking off is unclear from the research scientists' findings.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nevertheless, altogether, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years now, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background fact report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many researchers believe this could be connected to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="10">The now detached colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="12">It thereby grows out ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="14">The equilibrium between growing and breaking off became disrupted north of this ice shelf a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">An entire ice shelf crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger too, for the front edge has never retreated so far back as it currently is.</seg>
<seg id="17">What is more, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="18">The melting of shelf ice and icebergs do not raise sea water levels, since they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it itself produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers feeding directly into the sea, and being able to flow out much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="20">The could potentially raise sea water levels, though only to a small degree, writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="21">According to information from the AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf, at almost 50,000 square metres, is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is up to 700 metres thick where it meets the mainland, and around 200 metres at the front edge to the open ocean.</seg>
<seg id="23">It regularly breaks off there.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Although this is a natural event, and we’re not aware of any direct link to climate change, this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position," says Martin O'Leary from Britain's Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This is the furthest back that it has been since records began," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is disagreement among scientists as to whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or whether it is receding long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="27">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, nevertheless, very many ice shelfs in the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="29">This long tail of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to data from the research programme the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="31">The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees in the last 50 years and is amongst those areas where temperatures are rising most quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2">Since it is getter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available, the CDU is calling for secession from the employers' association, so as to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shortly before the Summer recess, the district assembly rubber-stamped 41 new posts in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 1100 permanent staff members and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now another 17 trainees once more have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The apprenticeship positions at the district are apparently very coveted.</seg>
<seg id="7">There were around 620 applications recorded for the places on offer this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the district is lacking additional personnel which it needs to overcome growing demands and duties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently there are 50 positions at the district of Mettmann that are still unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sought after are, among others, doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to seize the initiative in the district assembly and counter the dearth of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="12">The administration is to "work out a plan for acquiring and developing staff," in line with the wishes of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan is not only to satisfy short-term demand in skilled workers, but, with a view to the future, to counteract the shortage of applicants, it is reported.</seg>
<seg id="14">The entire concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for lateral entry employees, and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="15">Well that does sound like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the district has staffing problems, the likes of which it has not seen before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other cities poach good officials and staff members and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The talk is of a downright "contest between public employers".</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="20">High time to act then, so that not even more positions remain unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, is, with his party, going even beyond the joint request.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just recently he caused a huge surprise in the district assembly when he publicly called the staff capping into question and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="23">Völker wants all avenues to be examined that enable a secession from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we don't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the unions – perhaps also in collaboration with the district's towns – to secure an in-house wage agreement," said Völker.</seg>
<seg id="25">The CDU are thereby attempting to pay the permanent staff and officials better than the pay-scale for public sector workers actually allows for.</seg>
<seg id="26">Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, and there are only raises or more money when moves into a more senior level, which is based on years experience.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet the district's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time a few weeks ago, new premises had to be erected for staff to tackle the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum, County Commissioner Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>

<seg id="1">Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="2">Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="4">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>

<seg id="6">The first tour led along the vineyards, amidst hot summer temperatures, to the Chapel of St. Michael above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="7">There followed viewing spots, some on towers, from which one could look far and wide over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="8">In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim, to the salt works and to the Wurstmarkt festival.</seg>
<seg id="10">Again, there came vantage point after vantage point, strung together with "flowing" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the last two days, lots of high altitudes were on the cards again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment cabins brought welcome pauses.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing salt water in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="14">They headed for Neustadt too.</seg>

<seg id="14">With prominent e-sportspeople under contract, it would be possible to be present online in these markets vastly more often than the mere once a year the national team gets sent to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="15">What exactly is it about?</seg>
<seg id="16">In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football simulator FIFA are battled out on a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="17">Just like in the regular sport, leagues have long been established, in which the pros compete against one another.</seg>
<seg id="18">And for the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="19">But is it even a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="20">For many people, this notion certainly takes some getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ingo Froböse also grappled with this question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the professor at the German Sports University of Cologne, e-sport is a sport, because it is competitive and features many biological and physical reactions that one also finds in classic sport – for example, a raised heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it requires cognitive capabilities, technical and tactical understanding and an ability to react quickly.</seg>
<seg id="24">Professional gamers ought to train not only on the console, but also their bodies, and should pay attention to their diet.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="26">Froböse sees problems too though: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue".</seg>
<seg id="27">For online games it is difficult to implement testing, and the scene is lacking the structures of the classic sport.</seg>
<seg id="28">The scientist positively stresses the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="29">The players travel internationally, it is like a big global family, and there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study from consultancy firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2016, it turned over 50 million euros in Germany, many through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="32">In three years, the turnover should total 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="33">Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga that is admittedly scant.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the e-sport is "no longer far off other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="35">Many countries internationally are already further ahead.</seg>
<seg id="36">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="37">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sport bookmaker Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Europe too, quite a bit is happening.</seg>
<seg id="39">E-sport has been introduced to the curriculum in a Norwegian school, says Froböse.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the Netherlands and in France, the top division football clubs are now committed to setting up an e-sport department, according to Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Compared with the rest of Europe, Germany is lagging behind," declares VfB board member, Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="42">Simply to slide back into nostalgia and romanticise the old days is no longer enough these days.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's about preserving the tradition of the club while at the same time aligning the business with the modern market.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are living in a digitalised world," says Dutt as well.</seg>
<seg id="45">"So you can't cling on to the idea that only in football, everything stays as it always was."</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="1">Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini Lahm</seg>
<seg id="2">It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to take to the field as captain at the Audi Cup.</seg>
<seg id="3">FC Bayern thinks the Confederations Cup winner is capable of a big season – a bit of extra motivation doesn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="4">Something was different there at his place in the dressing room; Joshua Kimmich noticed that immediately, even if the extra piece of kit was very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm anywhere to be seen, and no Manuel Neuer either, he simply put the band he'd been allocated on his arm.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The coach didn't announce it", explained the Confederations Cup winner later, after his first outing as Bayern captain.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sure, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Out of the C team of youth players, debutants and pros just back from the holidays, it was not the eight-years-older Arturo Vidal that was chosen as captain, but him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, it is those that one thinks capable, those who one wants to keep happy that one likes to give treats to the most.</seg>
<seg id="11">And anyone chosen to take on the mantel of Lahm can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kimmich confirmed: "That is what one wants as a player: to take on responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="13">The 22-year-old darted over the field like a mini Lahm on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Right back, that's his position now; the white armband cast its habitual spell.</seg>
<seg id="15">And in general, Kimmich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the helm.</seg>
<seg id="16">He gave instructions, attempted to steer the out-of-practice troop.</seg>
<seg id="17">He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were busied with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (didn't really work); Renato Sanches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip (worked, but to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not make a negative impression on their first outings in the Bayern jersey.</seg>
<seg id="19">That worked out quite well though.</seg>
<seg id="20">Süle took to the field alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence – both performed excellently.</seg>
<seg id="21">The renowned Napoli attack often made heavy weather of it, and on top of that, Süle made a couple of successful attempts as the game developed.</seg>
<seg id="22">His team mate, Rudy, admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".</seg>
<seg id="23">But he too showed a decent performance on his debut.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shifting play, changing pace: "That's the style I was brought in for".</seg>
<seg id="25">Just how unused to new arrivals this Bayern world is could be seen after the match.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but as many as six or seven interviews in the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="27">Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp remarks in support of his new team mates.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Süle there: "I've already noticed what went wrong here.</seg>
<seg id="29">At Bayern, you just have to win every game."</seg>
<seg id="30">He doesn't have to teach the newbies that anymore though.</seg>

<seg id="1">Companies happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing's speed</seg>
<seg id="2">The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irreconcilable when Evaline Lemke (The Greens) was still Rhineland Palatinate's Economic Affairs Minister.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) being in office.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chambers and companies from the region are responding to a TV enquiry by speaking of a change in economic policy – and at the same time rebuke the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frank Natus, chairman of the association of Trier companies Vereinigung Trierer Unternehmen (VTU) says: "Wissing is addressing the wishes of the industry, all of which Lemke blocked."</seg>
<seg id="6">Natus considers the biggest U-turn to be in infrastructure policy: linking the A1 motorway between Kelber and Adenau is now right at the top of the state's list of priorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ministry hopes that planning procedures will be in place this year already, and the construction rights should hold until 2021.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Trier western bypass also plays a role in the state's plans, being in the priority need category of The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">The goal is to put the stretch into service in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">Natus sees in this a roadmap for supporting regional, but internationally competitive, companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving, as spurred on by Wissing, to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sagging German wine exports.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Wissing is said to have a sympathetic ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK applauded.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Trier Chamber of Trades sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman examination, and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master craftsman training.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state's list of homework assignments remains long though.</seg>
<seg id="16">Facts have to presented quickly for the road construction planned, and at the same time the state is lacking the necessary human resources, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Trier IHK.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ at the Federal State Office for Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled thus far.</seg>
<seg id="18">The IHK is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary faction Christian Baldauf points to calculations from the Court of Auditors: in 2017 and 2018, the state is investing more than 20 million euros less on maintaining federal state roads than recommended.</seg>
<seg id="20">Frank Natus is also still expecting the state to put forward a policy as to how it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also sobering is the expansion of broadband in the state up until now.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2016, in an IHK survey, local companies had evaluated the mains supply with a mark of only 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="23">They complained about sluggish internet connections and outages.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lemke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe – from where, after four months, she has already bid a retreat due to disagreements.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughing in the face of sorrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Mordillo was for a while one of the most-published cartoonists; his figures' bulbous noses are his trade mark.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and is working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="4">His message: Laughing, "Because there's too much sorrow in the world."</seg>
<seg id="5">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4th August 1932 in Buenos Aires, the son of a Spanish immigrant.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his first years as an artist he struggled along as an illustrator for celebration cards, amongst other things – which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Following posts in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60s he finally got his breakthrough: when his cartoons were published in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" as well, and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="10">The artist always let himself be inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="11">Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort around in his drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the early morning, he sits at his drawing desk, still today according to his own statements, and works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="13">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his whimsical figures are still disseminated widely around the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, he has been working for six years on an animated film and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe – Mordillo's favourite animal in his drawings – who has a millipede as his nemesis.</seg>
<seg id="16">His figures are speaking for the first time in the 3D film, which should hit cinema screens in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">“I don’t know exactly what they are going to say; it is odd for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="18">The screenplay was not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore he is focussing rather on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is being produced without words.</seg>

<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="1">In the storm: pile-up on the A8: four injured</seg>
<seg id="2">Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: just shy of 30 vehicles were caught up in a mass collision.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are numerous people injured, kilometre-long queues – and rubberneckers.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the motorway between Stuttgart and Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured late on Thursday afternoon in a mass collision.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to initial police information, just shy of 30 vehicles, among which were probably also lorries, had crashed into each other during a storm at around 5pm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (in the rural district of Aichach-Friedberg).</seg>
<seg id="6">No information is initially available about the precise number of injured people.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was a big squad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="10">A roughly 10-km long tailback formed in the direction travelling towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="11">As an AZ journalist reports, there were massive disruptions in the opposite lane as well – due to numerous rubberneckers.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fire brigade noted down the registration numbers of the drivers, who are now expecting severe penalties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shortly after 6.45pm, there was then a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collision between a car transporter and a passenger car had occurred.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deutsche Bahn: Company trials "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a moment that practically everyone has experienced at one time or another: without expecting it, you're sitting in the train asleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or one is buried deep in one's work and has just had a genius idea.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then: bang.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conductor comes and rudely awakens you, or tears the passenger from the midst of his workflow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the days of being interrupted will soon be over.</seg>
<seg id="8">Deutsche Bahn is currently trialling conductorless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9">One simply uses one's mobile to confirm that one has taken one's seat, thereby validating the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trial operations are currently running on two lines.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If the service is well-received, we'll extend it.</seg>
<seg id="12">It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many additional long-distance lines across Germany," said a spokesperson for the railway.</seg>
<seg id="13">The railway is calling this conductorless ticket validation "Comfort Check-in".</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to use it, however, a few conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you have to have booked an online ticket – which most passengers do already anyway.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, you have to have bought it over the Railway's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case.</seg>
<seg id="17">And lastly, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="18">For "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on board the train and call up your ticket in "My Tickets".</seg>
<seg id="19">The trial customers will then see a button for electronic validation.</seg>
<seg id="20">The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is onboard the train and has occupied booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="22">So you can carry on sleeping, working, doing nothing.</seg>
<seg id="23">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for customers, and one for the railway – which, in turn, should benefit passengers.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion, without having his/her ticket inspected by our on-train staff, simply checks in him/herself in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="25">This allows passengers to personalise their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, Director of Marketing at DB Fernverkehr.</seg>
<seg id="26">A second plus: "And our employees will have more time than they currently do to see to the needs of individual customers".</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who travels by train a lot knows that, alongside delays and missing your train, ticket inspection is one of the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="28">For often you yourself, or, in any case, one of your fellow passengers, doesn't have all the documentation on them that one needs to validate an online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="29">Either the credit card is missing, or the ID card, or some other document that one needs to show.</seg>
<seg id="30">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or wider area and delays in one's own ticket getting checked, and ultimately it takes away the conductor's time to see to other matters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only a small number of trial customers can use the new service as of yet.</seg>
<seg id="32">And only on the connections ICE 915, between Dortmund and Stuttgart, and ICE 912, between Stuttgart and Essen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled.</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bit Galerie is moving people although it is still far from being built.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is barely anyone left indifferent to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg".</seg>
<seg id="6">Whereas some say of the Bit Galerie, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or, "That would be really fantastic" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side we hear, "No-one needs that" (Siggi Betzen) or, put quite bluntly: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="7">Whilst those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town, which would benefit the other businesses as well, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be haemorrhaged.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition: The gallery is being planned for exactly the plot where the covered farmers' market is, where 13 direct sellers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="9">When construction begins, that will be the end of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Galerie creators want to integrate a covered market into the new building – and, indeed, towards Beda Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="11">Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the covered market for years now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Principally our eggs, but also, always with great pleasure, the delicious cakes of our rural women.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have also discovered the butcher's for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="14">We hope that also while the Galerie is being built, but above all after, there will be the chance to maintain this offering.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's what they have in other cities too.</seg>
<seg id="16">The small covered market in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="17">Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers settle in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="18">But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project."</seg>
<seg id="19">Eva Kilic: "Why a shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="20">Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are plenty of those in our city already.</seg>
<seg id="22">One sees, though, how many shop premises stand empty here – some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market.</seg>
<seg id="24">For after all, the goods on offer there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer, and are good value to boot.</seg>
<seg id="25">As you see, shop premises in shopping centres are only rented by big companies, because the rents there are often not tenable for retail traders.</seg>
<seg id="26">Shame – there are hardly any specialist shops left any more and those that are still around will then probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="27">Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a covered market doesn't match up for me.</seg>
<seg id="28">And the Galerie doesn't suit Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="29">In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing?</seg>
<seg id="30">The old Edeka would be the solution – even in the long term, if the Bit Galerie does actually arrive eventually.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or is the spectre of the Bit Galerie managing even ahead of time to drive all businesses out of Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="32">George Marquet: "It simply will not work.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a shopping centre that stands empty – no-one needs that either.</seg>
<seg id="34">In my opinion, it would be better to support a proper farmers' market, instead of this Galerie.</seg>
<seg id="35">But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the crazily large number – as I see it – of pointless construction projects in Bitburg</seg>
<seg id="36">If the covered market is destroyed, then another piece of culture will disappear."</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="1">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news</seg>
<seg id="2">Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.</seg>
<seg id="8">She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="1">Military reform in Turkey – Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2">Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August, the highest military council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="3">So too this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">At first glance, a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously, but rather in the Prime Minister's official residence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taking part in the discussions chaired by the head of government were now also the five vice premiers, as well as the ministers for defence, the interior, justice, and foreign affairs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The civilians were thus in the majority in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government is tightening the reins on the military.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the marines were removed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">As of this week in Ankara, trials are being held against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt at overthrow as a "gift from God", since it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="15">But does Erdogan really have control over the army?</seg>
<seg id="16">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters".</seg>
<seg id="17">There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other ways, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="18">The big clean-up of the army and the security forces is continuing anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the middle of July, Erdogan fired, by decree, an additional 7395 public servants, among whom were 2303 policeman and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, it seems as if Erdogan has tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="21">Previously, the generals were deemed the true authorities in the country.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three times they staged a coup, invoking their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="23">After an election victory in 2002, Erdogan has been pushing back the strength of the military bit by bit, not least by invoking the reform guidelines of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="24">Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully promoting Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup out of fear of persecution, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="26">If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development.</seg>
<seg id="27">In any case, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army's readiness for action.</seg>
<seg id="28">The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.</seg>

<seg id="2">In recent months, there have been constant arguments about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle – now it is said to be moving very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are plans to build on the dilapidated stretch of track, on which the tourist trains travel, before the end of the year still.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle, construction works should begin on the line this year already, according to reports from the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renovate the Ilmnau-Rennsteig line, the state acknowledges that this is an important connection, above all for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="6">He estimated the costs for the repairs to the line to be around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">The state is taking on 75 per cent of this amount.</seg>
<seg id="8">The contract, on the basis of which, the shuttle is to be commissioned by the state in the future as well, is currently being finalised, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ministry and Süd-Thüringen Bahn, as operators, are said to already be in agreement over the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="11">The planned contract between the ministry and the train company is being concluded for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Rennsteig shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, beloved above all by tourists.</seg>
<seg id="14">In past months, as part of a pilot operation, there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future.</seg>
<seg id="15">The line is very run-down in places.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned</seg>
<seg id="2">Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yep.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sex robots are a big deal right now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's great feat?</seg>
<seg id="2">Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="3">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="3">Three of the graduating students will be going to the Gymnasium secondary school, and four to the Realschule.</seg>
<seg id="4">School headteacher Angelika Sitte greeted parents and public representatives in the Biesental community centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a symbol for the school graduation, the 29 students from the fourth grade, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose an eagle that is growing up in the chicken yard, but will be then released into the wild.</seg>
<seg id="6">Added to this, the lively bunch performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the Chicken Yard."</seg>
<seg id="7">Farmer Arnold found a curious egg and had his chickens hatch it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead of a chick, a small eagle emerged.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet hopes of making a chicken out of it were dashed; the eagle spread its wings out on a high mountain and vanished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Afterwards, grades three and four performed a chicken dance, staged by Yvonne Frank.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who were wearing top hats.</seg>
<seg id="12">The eagle stands for integration, said headteacher Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="13">The young animals may well be different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs amongst them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though it will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is its destiny to be free.</seg>
<seg id="16">She wished for every fourth grader that he/she would feel accepted in his/her new school.</seg>
<seg id="17">There followed a word of thanks to her colleagues, the former headteacher Michael Müller, who is always filling in when there are teacher shortages, and the parent representatives.</seg>
<seg id="18">The time as chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="19">She releases her students only very reluctantly, after two years of teaching, for it has been a really fantastic time.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the end, she was able to depend on the fourth graders.</seg>
<seg id="21">To close, all the students raised a song, with Summertime and Holiday Time.</seg>
<seg id="22">That brought out a lot of joy from the children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know</seg>
<seg id="2">How exactly is the software update taking place?</seg>
<seg id="3">Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative?</seg>
<seg id="4">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars classed under Euro emissions standard 5, and, some under Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="7">Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="8">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:</seg>
<seg id="9">Is the new initiative compulsory?</seg>
<seg id="10">No, the brokered software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The compulsory updates prior to this apply only to vehicles that have emissions test scamming software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered that they be retrofitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">How and from when are customers being notified of updates?</seg>
<seg id="14">The manufacturers have announced that there will be swift implementation in the coming months, but have not specified any precise deadline yet.</seg>
<seg id="15">Daimler has advised those affected to write to them.</seg>
<seg id="16">If an inspection is due anyway, this will be settled during the course of that.</seg>
<seg id="17">How long are the retrofittings likely to drag on for altogether?</seg>
<seg id="18">"Difficult to say," says Smetatnin.</seg>
<seg id="19">It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For we have seen that thus far, car manufacturers have not been acting of their own accord when it comes to matters of the environment."</seg>
<seg id="21">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="22">The retrofitting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage.</seg>
<seg id="23">It could be more laborious getting an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="24">What do car drivers do who don't drive a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel or the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="25">The ACE advises waiting.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foreign manufacturers would apparently follow suit, said Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="28">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="29">But just in those regions where there are threats of driving bans.</seg>
<seg id="30">In rural areas, there have as yet been no drops in value for older diesel cars.</seg>
<seg id="31">The ACE advises still waiting before selling.</seg>

<seg id="3">The first honours ceremony under President Trump promises to get political.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the award winners does not want to come – out of protest.</seg>
<seg id="5">LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, singers Gloria Estefan (59) and Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among those being honoured.</seg>
<seg id="7">The awards are handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="8">As is tradition, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and will take part in the presentation of awards, together with his wife Melania.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason, the award-winner Lear, made famous by a series of TV shows, already announced that he would not be attending the gala.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to the "New York Times": "This presidency has decided to completely turn its back on the arts and human rights – even take funding away from them – and that upsets me."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 59-year old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the biggest cultural establishment in the US capital.</seg>

<seg id="1">We're making the city liveable</seg>
<seg id="2">Roland Wacker, municipal architect in Haslach, is going into retirement next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The post has already been advertised – suitable applicants, though, are few and far between.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wacker has been municipal architect for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">And he still finds the work a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6">He reports of varied, but also demanding, tasks that await his successors.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, it surprises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="9">This should then allow enough time for induction training – observing usual notice periods.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Haslach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations, applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the town wants to maintain this role at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="12">If it could no longer fulfil it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="13">But accessibility for citizens is important to the town and to him too, says Wacker, who reports of a good working atmosphere and a cheerful mood between authorities and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="14">In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has amassed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We're making the city liveable," is something he is certain of, re: the building authorities and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in the future too, there are diverse projects on the agenda: the redesign of a former Hukla plot and of the Niederhofen carpark, for example, have been initiated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and refurbishment of the stadium is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros "if we do it properly", estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="19">"All in all, there are great tasks awaiting my successor.</seg>
<seg id="20">The work here is fun."</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect.</seg>
<seg id="22">With Haslach's own building yard and garden nursery, there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">"One can affect a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since the old town as a whole has protected building status, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" if new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing municipal architect.</seg>
<seg id="25">In any case, the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is master of construction: "In the end, everything here passes by my desk".</seg>
<seg id="27">For support and coordination, he can count on years-old colleagues: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been there ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering), already 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay".</seg>
<seg id="29">For continuity is important not only for a good working atmosphere, but also for the future design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone who wishes to take over from Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as graduate engineer or a bachelors degree with a specialisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws.</seg>
<seg id="31">The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering, urban land-use planning, land acquisition affairs, management of municipal property, the municipal depot with building yard and city nursery, and the lower board of building regulations, including preservation of sites of historic interest.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police, the as-of-yet unknown perpetrator had thrown the blue bicycle onto the cables from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116).</seg>
<seg id="3">These were so badly damaged in the course of this that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">Investigators are proceeding on the assumption that there were two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since last night.</seg>
<seg id="5">A pink scooter and bicyclist were observed near to the scene of the incident by witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This goes far beyond a roguish prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the damage to the locomotive and facilities, as well as the time in delays and the costs for the rail replacement services, the perpetrators could also be faced with railway customers' penalty fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Altogether, one can expect a "considerable" sum, said the spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="10">The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the southern railway stretch was able to be operated without obstructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday afternoon, two of them were long-distance trains.</seg>
<seg id="12">Freight trains were not cancelled, although they were delayed.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="14">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."</seg>

<seg id="1">New low blow for Martin Schulz – Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2">How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked, with a certain alarm, to Berlin before elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">No disturbances from party headquarters, no opposing winds from the state – that was the campaigners' biggest wish.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, that has fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.</seg>
<seg id="6">What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, you couldn't even begin to describe as an opposing wind.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those were low blows.</seg>
<seg id="8">And one after the other at that.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the surprising end to the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general sign of a move away from coalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This once again shows that Red-Green simply can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="11">The surprise resignation of a Green representative plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a stark crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Five months ahead of the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost their one-vote majority over the opposition made up of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="13">The national head of the Greens, Michael Kellner, has called on defecting Green representative in Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to give up her seat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cross-over to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the voters' will.</seg>
<seg id="15">Elke Twesten must immediately give up her seat", said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="16">"It just can't be true," sighed an SPD campaigner, when the bad news reached party headquarters on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is left without a governing majority after the cross-over of Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is the present crisis in a long line of big and small disasters in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="19">And no-one knows what is coming next.</seg>
<seg id="20">The misery began with the unexpectedly decisive defeat in the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="21">A black eye, no more, his comrades contented themselves at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything was going to be different.</seg>
<seg id="23">And it was too – in fact, everything was significantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="24">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tailspin, and the Düsseldorf washout bowled the party clean over.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their peers then picked themselves up again in the weeks afterwards, with some effort.</seg>
<seg id="26">Then, just as they had regained new faith, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="27">And with that came the next low blow.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD regional leader, lost his halo that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic hall while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="29">And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="31">And now Stephan Weil too.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been facing criticism for some time.</seg>
<seg id="33">Lousy poll results added to that.</seg>
<seg id="34">Despite that, or perhaps precisely because of that, Weil has been attempting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="35">The former mayor of Hanover's attempts to build up his power in Berlin have not gone unnoticed by peers in Martin Schulz's entourage.</seg>
<seg id="36">They used to let him do as he liked, since they expected Weil to be a stabilising force for the party.</seg>
<seg id="37">Now, just the opposite may happen.</seg>
<seg id="38">In actual fact, Weil is not to blame for the Lower Saxony Greens' party-internal strife.</seg>
<seg id="39">And Schulz is certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="40">For the time being, therefore, their peers are taking pains to keep their ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, at the defecting parliamentarian Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="43">Ms Twesten was voted into parliament not for her person, as a direct candidate, but on a Lower Saxony Green Party ticket, continued the Lower Saxony member of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="44">The logical conclusion would be for her to give up her seat.</seg>
<seg id="45">Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplored the "undemocratic manoeuvre".</seg>
<seg id="46">"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who as frontrunner is leading the Lower Saxony SPD into the Bundestag elections, to the RND.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Now the personal career notions of a future CDU representative is distorting the electoral result," continued Oppermann.</seg>
<seg id="48">He called for light to be shed on the circumstances surrounding the matter.</seg>
<seg id="49">I want to know whether there was anything more there, or if additional commitments were made to the Lower Saxony CDU.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grant money for Town Centre III</seg>
<seg id="2">Anyone who wants to renovate their outdated house will soon be able to get support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives for STEG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once more cast a glimpse back to what has been the case so far.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since 1991, there have been regeneration areas in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Back then, in regeneration area I, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount.</seg>
<seg id="7">From 2005 to 2016, in regeneration area II, the subsidy still lay at 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Schindler, the refurbishments up until this point have been a "successful project" – it is ultimately important to support interior development too, and not only develop new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 4th April, word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a regeneration area III.</seg>
<seg id="10">The grant amount is 833,333 euros, of which, 500,000 euros is to come from the federal state, the rest, from the municipality of Emfingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does a regeneration area come about?</seg>
<seg id="12">One will investigate, explains Schindler further, where the "truly old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="13">What also comes into play, however, is whether there is even any interest to renovate in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">If necessary, the area boundaries can also then be shifted again.</seg>
<seg id="15">STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="16">Keller presented the content of the government and federal state "Soziale Stadt" programme, within whose scope the refurbishments would then be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="17">The core of the programme is the revitalisation of town centres, the improvement of living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measures would be implemented on a property-specific, that is, per-premises, basis.</seg>
<seg id="19">The regeneration area would then ultimately be laid down as statute.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appropriation period for the subsidies has been running from 1st January 2017 and will continue to do so until 30th April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="21">First, however, stocktaking will be carried out until September of this year, as part of which, those with a stake in the regeneration area will receive a survey to fill out.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resolution should preferably follow in November or December, so that refurbishments can be begun next year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pietzschmann then explained that every community must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's about assessing the shortcomings in the urban design and deciding what will be renovated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="25">A renovation comment will then be recorded in the land registry for each premises.</seg>
<seg id="26">Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again himself and get an idea of the location, he promised.</seg>
<seg id="27">Gotzel stressed that the participation of those involved is an essential factor for the project's success.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is why there will be surveys, which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="29">The yellow survey is the "building and property survey", which is about, among other things, the structural condition and the intentions for refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the grey survey, the "budget and housing survey", information can be provided on the size, breakdown and residents of a living space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The blue "business survey" is only filled out if business premises operate in the building.</seg>
<seg id="32">It should be noted, however, Gotzel pointed out, that a filled-out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is more, new building initiatives are not eligible for funding.</seg>
<seg id="34">Schindler also stressed that funding would be allocated on a "first-come, first-served" basis – the early bird gets the worm.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not possible to "reserve" grant money for later.</seg>
<seg id="36">To conclude, photos of the "Town Centre II" project were shown, to "sell" the idea of refurbishment to those present.</seg>

<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2">Front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is competing at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.</seg>
<seg id="3">TC Blau-Weiss Neuss is competing tomorrow in Kiel, from 11am, at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite still flawless results after five matches, the front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is maintaining a sense of reality.</seg>
<seg id="5">Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a compact team that always plays in very similar formation.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the back positions, in particular, I find the team very good."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is above all the imports from the high north that bring class and stability to Suchsdorfer SV.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Their Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup appearances.</seg>
<seg id="10">And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).</seg>
<seg id="11">"It will be difficult for us, as always.</seg>
<seg id="12">You need a good dose of luck as well."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practically set.</seg>
<seg id="14">Maxime Janvier could give his debut for Blau-Weiß.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the Frenchman, currently still active in the challenger tournament in Italian Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, then Zdenek Kolar (Czech), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will be called into action for the first time this season.</seg>
<seg id="16">The as yet undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still hitting balls with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="17">He should also be there in Kiel though, just like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.</seg>
<seg id="18">After his two victories last Sunday against the Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move back into the team.</seg>
<seg id="19">If that's not enough for the 18-year-old from Hungary, who in January 2016 was still number one in the junior world rankings, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill out the squad.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald Trump didn't exactly look happy on Wednesday evening as he placed his signature under a bill that would see sanctions against Russia strengthened.</seg>

<seg id="1">Roll back in time: the city employs 46 kitchen assistants</seg>
<seg id="2">The city is once more organising the nursery lunch itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">With designated contact persons for the children and place in the team.</seg>
<seg id="4">The clock is being turned back in the city's nurseries.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the 1st September, the city of Krefeld is once more taking the catering in the city's nurseries (Kitas) into its own hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare services department, this is good news: "We were all delighted".</seg>
<seg id="7">The cooking is still done off premises: a caterer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled food.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city operates 46 nurseries in the district of Krefeld; in 44 of these, the children get a warm meal at midday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the last nursery year, 2800 children sat at the tables in each case, and demand is growing steadily.</seg>
<seg id="10">"By now, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week that eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The service is also available for the 35-hour care option, when children stay until 2pm."</seg>
<seg id="12">46 part-time staff are on kitchen duty on 1st September: they warm up the delivered meals, supplement them with salad, crudités and fruit, put the meals into individual portions, hand out the food, clear up, wash up and clean the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The workers are assigned to a fixed Kita," says Pommeranz.</seg>
<seg id="14">The size – there are two-group and seven-group establishments – dictates the number of hours worked.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The kitchen assistants now firmly belong in the Kita team," says Pommeranz contentedly.</seg>
<seg id="16">"That way they are much more closely involved, and it is easier for the nursery head to put educational concepts in place."</seg>
<seg id="17">Because it's about this too: a healthy diet and cooking lessons.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The children should help prepare the food."</seg>
<seg id="19">Directly linking the kitchen staff to the team makes sense then.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the children too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"They have a known staff member in the Kita, someone who is familiar to them, and not people who are continuously changing."</seg>
<seg id="22">This continuity is important for the children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cleaning of the nursery rooms – up until now also a task for the kitchen staff – will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel.</seg>
<seg id="24">This option – the separation of cleaning and the kitchen service – not only improves the quality of the kitchen's output, but also has the appeal of having turned out to be the most economical option for the city when comparing costs between in-house and outsourcing, said the press office.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that is despite 46 new part-time staff being employed.</seg>
<seg id="26">"But these hours don't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="4">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still causing debate.</seg>
<seg id="5">After its publication, Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedikt XVI.</seg>
<seg id="6">It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret over their own failures or their false assessments of events back then.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Domspatzen using "double standards".</seg>
<seg id="8">With respect to the assaults in Regensburg, no-one doubts that these were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future; however, what was striking was the "level of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is now a part of our everyday experience and sets up public opinion for considering that as normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio that "people love to let loose on the Church, and it is an easy target".</seg>
<seg id="11">She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with cheeky children, of which I was one."</seg>
<seg id="12">She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="13">In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger cropped up a lot.</seg>
<seg id="14">Absolutely unfair, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who together with Ratzinger compiled the commemorative volume "My Brother, the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="15">"I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, for in his assessment, the result of the final report "has nothing to do with him".</seg>
<seg id="16">What exactly is in the 440-page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg, has produced?</seg>
<seg id="17">In total, 547 members of the Regensburger Domspatzen were "highly likely" the victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="18">The final report said of Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, that "in summary, it can be determined that forms of corporal and physical violence were used by the cathedral's Master of Music R. in many cases".</seg>
<seg id="19">When he was highly emotional, in particular, the punishment for the students could be a lot more severe.</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite this, it is apparent that, in contrast to numerous others of the accused, many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hesemann explains in the interview why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="22">For Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="23">On the one hand, many students stress his "humaneness".</seg>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, he also comes across as a choleric type and perfectionist, who would often turn to violence if one of the Domspatzen didn't give a top musical performance.</seg>
<seg id="25">How do you judge this final report as his biography?</seg>
<seg id="26">Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort and reads the entire 440-page-long report from start to finish, one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Ratzinger is doing in there at all.</seg>
<seg id="27">Eight pages are devoted to him, all in one go, and he is clearly exculpated from every suspicion of complicity or connivance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="28">The extreme acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="29">At best, one can accuse him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Domspatzen secondary school, where he was active, was perceived by practically all of those asked as – to quote – "salvation", "heaven" and a "better world".</seg>
<seg id="31">So, the vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger a quite glowing testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beloved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provide the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always mobbed by clusters of children".</seg>
<seg id="32">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which from time to time also led to outbursts of anger.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that during the course of this he not only banged chairs and threw his bunch of keys to the floor, but even handed out slaps around the face and pulled on the hair or ears of all-too-impudent boys is something that he himself already admitted years ago, that he deeply regrets and apologises for.</seg>
<seg id="34">In his defence, however, it must also be said that such methods of education in that questionable period between the 1960s and 1970s were wide-spread amongst parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Do you remember such castigation methods?</seg>
<seg id="36">I'm thinking of those of us who were born before 1968, of course.</seg>
<seg id="37">I too experienced that, in a secular school, too, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="38">Compared to what this report is actually about, namely, appalling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at preschool, these are of course mere trifles.</seg>
<seg id="39">So one cannot help but ask whether the fact that lots of media are bearing down on him in particular does not have more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI.</seg>
<seg id="40">Indeed, lots of people are still slaving away assiduously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him.</seg>
<seg id="41">But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="42">In the media, there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="43">Is Georg Ratzinger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complicity in respect of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="44">Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly not.</seg>
<seg id="45">Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have confided in the cathedral's Master of Music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not once were the parents brought in the loop.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I never dared talk about it with my father or my mother," said one of those affected, as a representative for the others, "It was always very embarrassing for me".</seg>
<seg id="48">But the real problem when it comes to throwing light on sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims stay silent out of shame.</seg>
<seg id="49">If they don't even confide in parents and siblings, then they for sure are not going to to a choir leader, who after all had been a professional colleague, as it were, of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="50">How do the Domspatzen schoolboys judge Ratzinger's role in respect of the cases of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="51">Michael Hesemann: One pupil asked put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators in question.</seg>
<seg id="52">I also think... it is quite absurd to assume that... boys opened up more emphatically or clearly or even sooner to him, of all people, than to their parents, the heads of their boarding houses, mentors etc.</seg>
<seg id="53">That one would speak with him about sex... – unthinkable."</seg>
<seg id="54">So, the report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "That affected pupils and/or those around them confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="55">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has therefore been absolved of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="56">Therefore, he can also not be accused of not having stopped it or reported it.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is therefore also no reason to bring his good name into association with this despicable crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the media, one read a lot about "extreme acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="59">The former cathedral Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye".</seg>
<seg id="60">Does he have to live with this accusation then?</seg>
<seg id="61">Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed up and confounded into a huge melange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and somewhere, in the middle of that, was Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="62">But precisely that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is to say, there is a clean separation there: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as, shall we say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="64">What is more, the report handles cases from the period since 1945, that is, from four decades, as well, when Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="65">The whole hideous educational theory of spanking, the cases where boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers, and from which they suffered terribly, all of these took place in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="66">Yet the cathedral's Master of Music Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with these, for he first set eyes on the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="67">There, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the topic of the "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="68">One was only happy to have got away from it and enjoyed the much better treatment and the conditions that were even "paradisiacal" for many.</seg>
<seg id="69">What was different at the Domspatzen secondary school then?</seg>
<seg id="70">Michael Hesemann: Discipline still ruled there, sure, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="71">And that applies to Georg Ratzinger likewise, in relation to whom the report concludes that "many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."</seg>
<seg id="72">So, at best, there remains the accusation of having turned a blind eye.</seg>
<seg id="73">Yet despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was given reports about the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="74">The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible (according to the witness), and then next only in around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="75">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically close his ears to the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="76">Michael Hesemann: No, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen secondary school, which was even reproduced in the report.</seg>
<seg id="77">In that, he pointed this out, "that in the preschool corporal punishment is still practised."</seg>
<seg id="78">Even when facing the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="79">That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="80">Before that, it was taking place in a legal grey zone, as every one of us well knows.</seg>
<seg id="81">So it was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerating or dramatising and where the permissible limits had really been overstepped.</seg>
<seg id="82">But one cannot say that he always turned a blind eye.</seg>
<seg id="83">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="84">It was first in 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="85">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis indeed asserts that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that earlier time.</seg>
<seg id="86">What is your opinion on this?</seg>
<seg id="87">Michael Hesemann: We historians talk here about "the pitfall of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Princess is quite right here.</seg>
<seg id="89">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was despicable at all times, and also not to that which was perpetrated in the preschool in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then.</seg>
<seg id="90">That is all absolutely terrible and I am glad that it is finally being looked into.</seg>
<seg id="91">But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="92">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, slapping around the face and pulling the hair and ears, was widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="93">When corporal punishment was then banned, he complied strictly with that too.</seg>
<seg id="94">What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect then in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother, the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="95">Did the subject of corporal punishment ever come up?</seg>
<seg id="96">Michael Hesemann: Look, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedikt XVI., told from his perspective, so the Domspatzen played only a subsidiary role.</seg>
<seg id="97">Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he ran a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="98">But this too has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to forge from the Regensburger Domspatzen – up until that point famous rather on a national level – a world-class institution, a cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, that twice a-piece went on tour to the USA (1983 and 1987) and to Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="99">Not with biscuits and sweets alone does one all at once turn insubordinate boys into great singers, and face every success, regardless of the area, but rather, with continuous discipline, passion and self-conquest.</seg>
<seg id="100">What kind of impression did you get of Georg Ratzinger the man then in those conversations for your book?</seg>
<seg id="101">Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really very well, and my experience of him was always as a wonderful, humorous, totally benevolent, deeply devout and good-hearted man, who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hurting a fly.</seg>
<seg id="102">I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still today keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him – he is almost blind – and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="103">Those who up until today still do not forgive him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="104">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them nearer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="105">And for always being a good, fatherly teacher – a strict father, sure, that may well be – but also a loving person, to be respected, whom they still look up to today and downright worship.</seg>
<seg id="106">And please, once more, just to be clear: all that he is accused of are methods of education, that back then were order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="107">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="108">But it is highly unjust to make a media scapegoat out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.</seg>
<seg id="109">The evil intention behind that is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="110">For the report that was just published exonerates him.</seg>
<seg id="111">Now one would ask for the decency to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has rendered great service and without whom probably no-one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Regensburger Domspatzen</seg>

<seg id="2">There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).</seg>
<seg id="3">It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="4">AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="5">One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."</seg>
<seg id="6">For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="8">A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.</seg>
<seg id="12">In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.</seg>
<seg id="14">AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.</seg>
<seg id="16">AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle</seg>
<seg id="2">"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Today, there's neither."</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="5">"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."</seg>
<seg id="7">As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."</seg>
<seg id="8">Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."</seg>
<seg id="10">Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.</seg>
<seg id="11">The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="12">A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.</seg>
<seg id="13">St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."</seg>
<seg id="16">The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."</seg>
<seg id="17">The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.</seg>
<seg id="19">What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.</seg>

<seg id="2">A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!</seg>
<seg id="6">I got bit!'</seg>
<seg id="7">His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.</seg>
<seg id="12">Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.</seg>
<seg id="7">The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.</seg>
<seg id="12">The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.</seg>
<seg id="17">We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."</seg>

<seg id="2">Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV</seg>
<seg id="3">Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.</seg>
<seg id="5">This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.</seg>
<seg id="6">Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="8">The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.</seg>
<seg id="10">A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it could mean the end of a long friendship.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.</seg>
<seg id="19">The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.</seg>
<seg id="20">Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="21">A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."</seg>

<seg id="4">Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.</seg>

<seg id="7">But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were going to war with North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="13">Millions of people would have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now we have this great relationship."</seg>
<seg id="15">He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.</seg>
<seg id="16">And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.</seg>

<seg id="7">Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.</seg>
<seg id="8">While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.</seg>
<seg id="11">Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="12">A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.</seg>
<seg id="13">President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.</seg>
<seg id="14">But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.</seg>
<seg id="16">More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.</seg>

<seg id="2">Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.</seg>
<seg id="4">He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."</seg>
<seg id="9">Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row</seg>
<seg id="2">Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."</seg>
<seg id="4">John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.</seg>
<seg id="11">His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."</seg>

<seg id="2">A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.</seg>
<seg id="8">A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="9">"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.</seg>
<seg id="10">Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.</seg>
<seg id="11">His body was found about an hour later.</seg>
<seg id="12">The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.</seg>
<seg id="13">A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US</seg>
<seg id="2">As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="11">As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="12">Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.</seg>
<seg id="15">The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.</seg>
<seg id="17">This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="20">October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="24">Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.</seg>
<seg id="25">Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="26">New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="8">Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="12">ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="13">CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Interest remained high after the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?</seg>
<seg id="20">He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""</seg>
<seg id="21">Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.</seg>
<seg id="24">Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.</seg>
<seg id="25">After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.</seg>
<seg id="26">Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.</seg>

<seg id="8">The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary</seg>
<seg id="2">Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.</seg>
<seg id="3">A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."</seg>
<seg id="6">Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.</seg>
<seg id="8">Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.</seg>
<seg id="11">The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.</seg>
<seg id="12">Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.</seg>
<seg id="14">I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's getting more and more tense," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers</seg>
<seg id="2">Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory</seg>
<seg id="3">Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors</seg>
<seg id="9">Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.</seg>
<seg id="10">Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.</seg>
<seg id="14">By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,</seg>
<seg id="15">That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis</seg>
<seg id="19">BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena</seg>
<seg id="20">A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="21">To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="23">He had so many heroes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rangers were short of inspiration, though.</seg>
<seg id="26">As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!</seg>
<seg id="6">Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="12">First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.</seg>
<seg id="14">The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.</seg>
<seg id="20">These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.</seg>

<seg id="2">"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising</seg>
<seg id="2">At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="11">The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.</seg>
<seg id="13">The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.</seg>
<seg id="17">Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.</seg>
<seg id="21">In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.</seg>
<seg id="23">Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.</seg>
<seg id="24">The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.</seg>
<seg id="25">The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="3">While World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">That has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.</seg>

<seg id="16">"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.</seg>
<seg id="18">His messages, though, only resulted in one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. should double A.I. funding</seg>
<seg id="2">As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="18">And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name</seg>
<seg id="2">The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.</seg>
<seg id="6">The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."</seg>
<seg id="7">Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.</seg>
<seg id="10">The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="14">Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.</seg>
<seg id="18">If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."</seg>
<seg id="22">A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.</seg>
<seg id="23">Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.</seg>
<seg id="26">A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">"All of what we've done is at stake in November.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.</seg>
<seg id="7">And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.</seg>
<seg id="8">They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."</seg>
<seg id="9">Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."</seg>
<seg id="10">"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."</seg>
<seg id="11">He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Remember her answer?</seg>

<seg id="1">Labour is no longer a broad church.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is intolerant of those who speak their minds</seg>
<seg id="3">When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.</seg>
<seg id="5">My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.</seg>
<seg id="6">In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."</seg>
<seg id="9">For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.</seg>
<seg id="11">It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.</seg>
<seg id="12">This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that is not just my experience.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that is not what I came into politics to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.</seg>
<seg id="24">No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.</seg>
<seg id="25">To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.</seg>
<seg id="26">But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."</seg>
<seg id="7">Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.</seg>
<seg id="8">Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.</seg>
<seg id="9">But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.</seg>
<seg id="13">Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.</seg>

<seg id="1">'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific</seg>
<seg id="2">Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.</seg>
<seg id="4">Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.</seg>
<seg id="5">To recover it is a duty."</seg>
<seg id="6">Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="10">Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.</seg>
<seg id="12">But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.</seg>
<seg id="15">And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.</seg>
<seg id="19">The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.</seg>
<seg id="20">Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."</seg>

<seg id="2">If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.</seg>
<seg id="3">Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.</seg>
<seg id="4">Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.</seg>
<seg id="6">Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.</seg>
<seg id="9">One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.</seg>

<seg id="11">Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.</seg>

<seg id="13">The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.</seg>
<seg id="3">With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.</seg>
<seg id="11">The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.</seg>
<seg id="12">This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.</seg>
<seg id="16">With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.</seg>
<seg id="21">Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="24">Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.</seg>
<seg id="26">It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.</seg>
<seg id="27">Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."</seg>
<seg id="28">Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.</seg>
<seg id="29">Il faut bien le faire.</seg>

<seg id="2">President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.</seg>
<seg id="13">Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles</seg>
<seg id="2">After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.</seg>
<seg id="4">So where would they say the momentum is now?</seg>
<seg id="5">"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.</seg>
<seg id="8">Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.</seg>
<seg id="10">His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is all each of these players has left now.</seg>
<seg id="13">18 holes to make a mark.</seg>
<seg id="14">The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.</seg>
<seg id="18">Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Talk of European glory remains premature, though.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.</seg>
<seg id="21">A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="24">Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.</seg>
<seg id="5">The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.</seg>
<seg id="9">Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.</seg>

<seg id="1">North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust</seg>
<seg id="2">North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.</seg>
<seg id="4">"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."</seg>
<seg id="6">While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.</seg>
<seg id="8">North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.</seg>
<seg id="9">Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.</seg>
<seg id="14">The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="18">China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."</seg>
<seg id="20">The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="23">He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."</seg>
<seg id="24">North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."</seg>
<seg id="25">He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.</seg>

<seg id="1">Harvard students take course in getting enough rest</seg>
<seg id="2">A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'</seg>
<seg id="3">An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.</seg>
<seg id="6">'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="8">The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.</seg>
<seg id="12">In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.</seg>
<seg id="14">'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.</seg>
<seg id="15">But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.</seg>
<seg id="16">The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.</seg>
<seg id="20">The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="8">Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.</seg>
<seg id="10">They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.</seg>
<seg id="11">A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.</seg>
<seg id="13">Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.</seg>
<seg id="17">Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.</seg>
<seg id="18">Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.</seg>
<seg id="20">Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.</seg>

<seg id="2">And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.</seg>
<seg id="4">A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:</seg>
<seg id="5">Man: "What in the world is that?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."</seg>
<seg id="8">Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"</seg>
<seg id="9">"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.</seg>

<seg id="2">It Didn't Go Well</seg>
<seg id="3">Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="5">"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They bullied me backstage.</seg>
<seg id="12">They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">They bullied me!</seg>
<seg id="14">And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="15">West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?</seg>
<seg id="16">Try love."</seg>
<seg id="17">His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."</seg>
<seg id="18">West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="19">West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.</seg>
<seg id="20">West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."</seg>
<seg id="21">But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="22">"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is free.</seg>
<seg id="24">So are we," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'</seg>
<seg id="8">Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.</seg>
<seg id="9">He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?</seg>
<seg id="10">What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?</seg>
<seg id="12">Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'</seg>
<seg id="13">In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.</seg>
<seg id="14">From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.</seg>
<seg id="15">The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.</seg>
<seg id="16">'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'</seg>
<seg id="2">U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.</seg>
<seg id="6">The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="8">Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."</seg>
<seg id="12">Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="15">When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They must not be defiant.</seg>
<seg id="17">They must not question the motives of the accuser.</seg>
<seg id="18">They must be calm and serene."</seg>
<seg id="19">Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Big if true," he tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="22">In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."</seg>

<seg id="1">Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof</seg>
<seg id="2">It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?</seg>
<seg id="4">At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="6">He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.</seg>
<seg id="8">I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="10">The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.</seg>
<seg id="11">The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.</seg>
<seg id="12">A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.</seg>
<seg id="16">English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days</seg>
<seg id="2">Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.</seg>
<seg id="3">The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.</seg>
<seg id="4">It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'</seg>
<seg id="9">The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.</seg>

<seg id="2">The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?</seg>
<seg id="2">This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.</seg>
<seg id="6">But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?</seg>
<seg id="7">Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.</seg>
<seg id="9">It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="10">In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="14">The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.</seg>
<seg id="15">In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"</seg>
<seg id="16">Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.</seg>
<seg id="18">Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.</seg>

<seg id="1">US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary</seg>
<seg id="2">Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."</seg>
<seg id="12">Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.</seg>
<seg id="5">"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."</seg>
<seg id="6">Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."</seg>
<seg id="10">A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thirty-two percent supported such a run.</seg>
<seg id="13">The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.</seg>

<seg id="1">18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy</seg>
<seg id="2">Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was detained in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="9">District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."</seg>
<seg id="12">Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.</seg>
<seg id="5">While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.</seg>
<seg id="6">China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="8">China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="1">Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn</seg>
<seg id="2">As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.</seg>
<seg id="9">"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.</seg>
<seg id="10">But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."</seg>
<seg id="11">Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook</seg>
<seg id="2">Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.</seg>
<seg id="3">The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's a historical moment."</seg>
<seg id="8">The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.</seg>
<seg id="9">It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.</seg>
<seg id="16">Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are not asking their permission."</seg>
<seg id="18">In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</seg>
<seg id="20">In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.</seg>

<seg id="2">The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.</seg>
<seg id="5">A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."</seg>
<seg id="8">He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.</seg>
<seg id="12">Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."</seg>

<seg id="3">The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.</seg>
<seg id="4">At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.</seg>
<seg id="6">One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.</seg>
<seg id="8">""Peppa the pig," yes."</seg>
<seg id="9">Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we are working on it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.</seg>
<seg id="14">We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="17">We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's an unfortunate situation."</seg>

<seg id="2">Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="5">He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="9">He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="12">The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="18">My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."</seg>
<seg id="19">His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.</seg>

<seg id="2">American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.</seg>
<seg id="6">And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.</seg>
<seg id="13">I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="16">It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He provides a lot more than just play."</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear</seg>
<seg id="2">Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.</seg>
<seg id="4">"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.</seg>
<seg id="5">So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.</seg>
<seg id="6">You go full bore tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Get out there and do all the right things.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not over till you've got the points on the board.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.</seg>
<seg id="10">I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."</seg>
<seg id="11">Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tomorrow's a different beast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.</seg>
<seg id="21">When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.</seg>
<seg id="22">We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.</seg>

<seg id="2">German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="4">The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="18">Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."</seg>
<seg id="19">The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.</seg>
<seg id="20">He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.</seg>

<seg id="1">National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats</seg>
<seg id="2">New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.</seg>
<seg id="5">Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.</seg>
<seg id="6">NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.</seg>
<seg id="8">A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.</seg>
<seg id="10">This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bats are not actually blind.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.</seg>
<seg id="16">They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.</seg>
<seg id="17">The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.</seg>
<seg id="20">Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="24">He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.</seg>
<seg id="27">She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."</seg>

<seg id="2">Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.</seg>
<seg id="3">His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."</seg>
<seg id="7">"No, no, no, no , no.</seg>
<seg id="8">What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They want to promote themselves by using my name.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's normal.</seg>
<seg id="11">They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."</seg>
<seg id="15">The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</seg>
<seg id="16">After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."</seg>
<seg id="18">The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."</seg>
<seg id="20">The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers</seg>
<seg id="2">The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.</seg>
<seg id="9">BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."</seg>
<seg id="17">Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.</seg>
<seg id="5">Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosenstein denied the report.</seg>
<seg id="7">But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."</seg>
<seg id="14">Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.</seg>
<seg id="15">Host Chris Wallace asked why.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="17">She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."</seg>
<seg id="19">Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.</seg>
<seg id="20">We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="21">Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Solo press conferences are rare.</seg>
<seg id="23">In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="6">An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.</seg>
<seg id="7">Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.</seg>
<seg id="9">He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.</seg>

<seg id="3">The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters</seg>
<seg id="4">The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK</seg>
<seg id="5">The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless</seg>
<seg id="6">Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.</seg>
<seg id="7">The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.</seg>
<seg id="8">The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="9">The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.</seg>
<seg id="14">He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that means fixing our broken housing market.</seg>
<seg id="19">Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.</seg>
<seg id="21">For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'</seg>
<seg id="2">Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.</seg>
<seg id="4">He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I wanted to play for my country as a player.</seg>
<seg id="6">I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.</seg>
<seg id="8">That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."</seg>
<seg id="9">Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="15">He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.</seg>
<seg id="20">But playing can be tough.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.</seg>
<seg id="22">I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.</seg>
<seg id="23">I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."</seg>

<seg id="1">Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds</seg>
<seg id="2">The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.</seg>
<seg id="7">Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="9">Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."</seg>
<seg id="10">Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="11">Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.</seg>
<seg id="12">It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.</seg>
<seg id="13">The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."</seg>
<seg id="14">Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.</seg>

<seg id="2">A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.</seg>
<seg id="3">To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."</seg>
<seg id="5">The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.</seg>
<seg id="7">With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.</seg>
<seg id="9">Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.</seg>
<seg id="12">But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."</seg>
<seg id="14">Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think this is a genus idea.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.</seg>
<seg id="18">The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a genius product," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."</seg>
<seg id="22">At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.</seg>
<seg id="23">The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.</seg>
<seg id="26">By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.</seg>
<seg id="12">The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.</seg>
<seg id="14">They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.</seg>

<seg id="2">Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="4">"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.</seg>
<seg id="8">France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."</seg>
<seg id="12">The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.</seg>
<seg id="13">UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."</seg>
<seg id="16">UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.</seg>

<seg id="2">By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="3">In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"</seg>
<seg id="4">As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.</seg>
<seg id="9">She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.</seg>
<seg id="10">The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why? she asked.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is entertainment value in the chaos.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.</seg>
<seg id="16">And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.</seg>
<seg id="17">I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).</seg>

<seg id="2">It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.</seg>
<seg id="3">This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.</seg>
<seg id="5">The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).</seg>
<seg id="7">Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off</seg>
<seg id="2">Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.</seg>
<seg id="4">State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.</seg>
<seg id="7">As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.</seg>

<seg id="2">The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.</seg>
<seg id="8">We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.</seg>
<seg id="9">The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Americans face several of these inflection points now.</seg>
<seg id="11">What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?</seg>
<seg id="12">Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="14">"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?</seg>
<seg id="15">And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?</seg>
<seg id="16">If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="18">My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.</seg>
<seg id="19">She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="3">A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.</seg>
<seg id="7">They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.</seg>
<seg id="8">Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.</seg>
<seg id="11">The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."</seg>

<seg id="1">Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.</seg>
<seg id="3">About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.</seg>
<seg id="5">"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's where to begin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.</seg>
<seg id="14">You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?</seg>
<seg id="17">Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's not just the financials that are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia</seg>
<seg id="2">At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.</seg>
<seg id="3">With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:</seg>
<seg id="6">Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.</seg>
<seg id="9">The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.</seg>
<seg id="14">A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:</seg>
<seg id="17">2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.</seg>
<seg id="18">2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id="20">2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.</seg>
<seg id="21">2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 1,100 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.</seg>
<seg id="24">2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="25">No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.</seg>
<seg id="26">2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.</seg>
<seg id="27">The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.</seg>

<seg id="2">Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.</seg>
<seg id="3">Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.</seg>
<seg id="5">Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.</seg>
<seg id="6">He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.</seg>
<seg id="7">Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.</seg>
<seg id="10">In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.</seg>
<seg id="11">His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.</seg>
<seg id="14">His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect</seg>
<seg id="2">Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.</seg>
<seg id="6">Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.</seg>
<seg id="9">Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.</seg>
<seg id="14">Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.</seg>
<seg id="19">David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations</seg>
<seg id="2">Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.</seg>
<seg id="9">He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="10">'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to make our own laws in our own country.'</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'</seg>
<seg id="15">Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.</seg>
<seg id="16">'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Please drop Chequers and start listening.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.</seg>
<seg id="20">'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'</seg>
<seg id="22">In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.</seg>
<seg id="23">'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="25">A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="26">Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.</seg>
<seg id="27">'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.</seg>
<seg id="28">'It is a complete farce.</seg>

<seg id="2">It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.</seg>
<seg id="3">From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.</seg>
<seg id="8">He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.</seg>

<seg id="1">That Was Really Bad Body Language</seg>
<seg id="2">President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't do it."</seg>
<seg id="7">Remember?</seg>
<seg id="8">Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?</seg>
<seg id="9">Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?</seg>
<seg id="10">Oh, no.</seg>
<seg id="11">I didn't leak."</seg>
<seg id="12">Well, wait one minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."</seg>
<seg id="17">But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="19">Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.</seg>

<seg id="5">Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.</seg>
<seg id="6">Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.</seg>

<seg id="12">The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake</seg>
<seg id="2">An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.</seg>
<seg id="5">But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.</seg>
<seg id="6">He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.</seg>
<seg id="7">He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="8">He died later in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="9">Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.</seg>
<seg id="11">Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clean water is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="19">The mini-markets are looted everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="20">Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."</seg>
<seg id="22">Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Are you ready?" CNN reported.</seg>
<seg id="24">Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.</seg>

<seg id="2">The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.</seg>
<seg id="4">The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.</seg>
<seg id="12">American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.</seg>
<seg id="17">Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.</seg>

<seg id="1">Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive</seg>
<seg id="2">The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.</seg>
<seg id="4">He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .</seg>
<seg id="6">When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.</seg>
<seg id="8">When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."</seg>
<seg id="9">Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He erased her from his life," Hale said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.</seg>

<seg id="2">NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text</seg>
<seg id="3">A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."</seg>
<seg id="4">The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="6">"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.</seg>
<seg id="8">After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="12">The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.</seg>
<seg id="13">"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.</seg>
<seg id="14">She's not a racist.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.</seg>
<seg id="16">"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?</seg>
<seg id="17">Your newborn baby?</seg>
<seg id="18">Come on."</seg>
<seg id="19">Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You're going to go after someone like that?</seg>
<seg id="21">That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."</seg>
<seg id="4">Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.</seg>

<seg id="2">"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.</seg>
<seg id="3">Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?</seg>
<seg id="4">Their reluctance is all due to timing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.</seg>
<seg id="6">George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.</seg>
<seg id="7">What happens after the FBI produces its report?</seg>
<seg id="8">There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="2">The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pyongyang has made no public comments.</seg>
<seg id="6">The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.</seg>
<seg id="9">China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court</seg>
<seg id="2">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.</seg>

<seg id="3">"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"</seg>
<seg id="5">She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am angry."</seg>
<seg id="7">And then she just kept going.</seg>
<seg id="8">And I thought that was brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="9">Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Never let them see you crying," she told me.</seg>

<seg id="16">"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""</seg>

<seg id="21">She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.</seg>
<seg id="23">When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.</seg>
<seg id="24">"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.</seg>

<seg id="1">How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing</seg>
<seg id="2">The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.</seg>
<seg id="6">China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.</seg>

<seg id="3">The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.</seg>
<seg id="4">Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5">US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.</seg>

<seg id="17">Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.</seg>

<seg id="2">Michael Jackson's former bodyguard has claimed the late singer cultivated some of his eccentricities with the deliberate intention of riling up the media.</seg>
<seg id="3">Matt Fiddes, now a property developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, told Metro that Jackson believed the fascination around his persona would stop if he ceased to be a "mystery" in the public eye.</seg>
<seg id="4">To get front pages, he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation.</seg>
<seg id="5">We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He knew how to manipulate the media. He knew exactly how to get the front page," Fiddes, who was Jackson's bodyguard for 10 years, said. "90 per cent of the time it worked, by putting a mask on his face, or sticky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one. He would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="7">He added: "It's backfired on him now, though, that's the sad thing."</seg>
<seg id="8">Fiddes also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, which were aired in the controversial, Emmy Award-winning documentary Leaving Neverland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both Robson and Safechuck allege that they were abused by Jackson as children for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fiddes claimed that "this whole paedophile thing is complete nonsense... the guy had girlfriends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie [Presley], that was the way he lived his life."</seg>
<seg id="11">He claimed it would have been "impossible" for Jackson to have abused children at his Neverland ranch because he was "hardly" there.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They say there were boys around, that was not the case at all," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star. Jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="1">Government Retires 15 More Senior Tax Officials On Graft Charges</seg>
<seg id="2">New Delhi:</seg>
<seg id="3">The government has compulsorily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tranche of its crackdown on errant officials accused of corruption and other malpractices.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) -- the agency that oversees GST and import tax collections -- compulsorily retired 15 senior officers under Fundamental Rule 56 (J) on corruption and other charges, official sources said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since June, this is the fourth round of sacking of corrupt tax officials. In the previous three rounds, 49 high ranking tax officers, including 12 from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), were compulsorily retired.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sources said the action was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort when he had said some black sheep in the tax administration may have misused their powers and harassed taxpayers, either by targeting honest assesses or taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We have recently taken the bold step of compulsorily retiring a significant number of tax officials, and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour," he had said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the CBI for allegedly receiving illegal gratification. One of them was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 15,000. One official is accused of having assets disproportionate to his known source of income.</seg>
<seg id="9">In June, the government had compulsorily retired 15 commissioner-level officials of CBIC on charges of corruption, collecting and giving bribes, smuggling and even criminal conspiracy. Prior to that, the government had compulsorily retired 12 senior IRS officials from the Income Tax department over charges of corruption, sexual harassment, disproportionate assets under Rule 56 (J) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, the government compulsorily retired 22 CBIC officials. The Rule 56 (J) of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 provides for periodical review of the performance of government servants with a view to ascertain whether they should be retained in service or retired in public interest.</seg>
<seg id="11">As per these instructions, the cases of government servants covered by FR 56 (J), 56 (1) or Rule 48 (1) (b) of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 should be reviewed six months before they attain the age of 50-55 years, in cases covered by FR 56 (j) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under FR 56 (1) or Rule 48 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.</seg>

<seg id="1">A woman in Maine got 500 letters from United Healthcare within five days</seg>
<seg id="2">Stephanie Lay said she found the piles of letters from the insurance company stashed in her mailbox between Thursday and Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A week ago Thursday was the first wave of letters, I got 46 letters," she told CNN. "I immediately called United Healthcare insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same letter."</seg>
<seg id="4">And the letters just kept coming, piling up to more than 500 by Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">They were addressed to her son, who has autism and lives in a private care facility, she said. But instead of her son's name inside when you opened them, the letters said Dear Maine's Department of Health and Human Services -- in Cincinnati, she told local media.</seg>
<seg id="6">The letters were about a $54 or $0 healthcare claim that United Healthcare said is not covered, Lay said.</seg>
<seg id="7">When she asked United Healthcare why she was receiving a mountain of letters, she was told it was a coding issue, she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a statement, United Healthcare told CNN it's working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have determined the cause of the problem. We are very sorry this occurred, and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them," the health insurer said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paperless. " I'm thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">British bank HSBC (HSBA.L) has converted a financial crime-spotting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities, bank executives said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The system combines data on clients" banking activities, with public data on company ownership and directorships, to flag desirable potential clients to HSBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships.</seg>
<seg id="4">Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HSBC's broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data, a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention, and the business we're getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win," said Stuart Nivison, HSBC's global head of client network banking.</seg>
<seg id="6">HSBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader "network income" initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.</seg>
<seg id="7">The drive is an important part of the bank's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">HSBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank's failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels though its Mexican unit.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system works by mapping individual customers" and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or unearthing previously unknown connections between those entities.</seg>
<seg id="10">That system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to client-facing roles where they can spend time helping customers, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade business.</seg>
<seg id="11">HSBC's Nivison said the lightbulb moment was realizing the tool could be repurposed to look for "green flags" of attractive potential clients rather than "red flags" of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We took our customer dataset and combined it with (Britain's) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client, whether that be through sector, growth of the company, and connection to existing clients," Nivison said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The tool has mapped 22.5 million entities and people in Britain, and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually, he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">European nations were so eager to negotiate with Iran that they suggested the US would end its sanctions regime if Tehran was willing to engage in dialogue, President Hassan Rouhani has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rouhani, European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump, promising that Washington would lift "all" sanctions in return.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Three out of the six countries, that is the chancellor of Germany, prime minister of Britain, and president of France, all insisted for the meeting to be held, saying that the US would lift all sanctions," stated the Iranian president.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said he rejected the proposal because, "under sanctions and maximum pressure," it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump quickly denied that he had offered Iran any relief, tweeting that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a prerequisite to talks, but that he had "of course" refused.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his statement, Rouhani also said that numerous countries were on Iran's side during their one-on-one talks on the sidelines of the UNGA. "We discussed various issues with various countries, and all of them condemned the United States" withdrawal from the JCPOA and its pressures. This is a huge success for Iran."</seg>

<seg id="1">Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation</seg>
<seg id="2">Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-control animals and irresponsible owners.</seg>
<seg id="3">A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public's views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scotland's Community Safety Minister pledged to "keep communities safe from irresponsible owners," with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-control dogs need changing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ash Denham MSP said: "We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-control dogs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Dogs Act 2010 can operate across Scotland, and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation."</seg>
<seg id="8">The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to toughen and clarify the current legislation, including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Scottish Parliament's Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, prompting the Government to review dog control laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">MSPs were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children.</seg>
<seg id="11">The committee heard that, in Greater Glasgow and Clyde alone, there were 1,417 people arriving at A&E departments with dog-related injuries, 255 of them children, last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">NHS Lanarkshire treated 912 people and NHS Ayrshire 439, both four-year highs.</seg>
<seg id="13">In July, the committee's MSPs concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog-control laws.</seg>
<seg id="14">Convener Jenny Marra said: "Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose. There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has become clear that current dog control law doesn't work. It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs."</seg>
<seg id="16">The consultation, launched on the Government's website on Friday, says: "Effective and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-control dogs.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities, as they use their powers to help keep communities safe."</seg>

<seg id="1">Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule</seg>
<seg id="2">Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.</seg>
<seg id="5">The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty."</seg>
<seg id="8">Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.</seg>
<seg id="9">Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.</seg>
<seg id="10">Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.</seg>
<seg id="11">Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="15">International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.</seg>
<seg id="18">It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.</seg>
<seg id="20">The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.</seg>
<seg id="24">The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.</seg>

<seg id="3">Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people's posts from today, but will still be able to see how people respond to their own.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We don't want Facebook to feel like a competition," the company said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is a test to see how people engage with this new format. We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly," it said.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform's impact on mental health.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country's eSafety commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Facebook's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide "likes" on the company's other major social media platform, Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="9">What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major markets.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Facebook trial was described as "a limited test in order for us to get some early learnings."</seg>
<seg id="11">"While this has been testing on Instagram, Facebook and (Instagram) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions," said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hurricane Lorenzo strengthened into a Category 4 storm Thursday, producing swells that could affect parts of the Windward Islands and South America, the National Hurricane Center said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The eye of the major hurricane was about 1,660 miles southwest of the Azores in the NHC's 11 p.m. EDT update. The storm was moving north-northwest at 14 mph with 145 mph maximum sustained winds.</seg>
<seg id="4">The storm isn't forecast to make landfall in the coming days, though a turn toward the northeast Saturday could bring Lorenzo near the Azores in the middle of next week. Forecasters predict the storm will weaken below Category 3 on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="2">U.S. Soldiers talk after a routine inspection of a Patriot missile battery at a Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send a Patriot missile battery, radars and roughly 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defense Secretary Mark Esper has "approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement. "While no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces, they will maintain a heightened state of readiness."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those additional forces include two Patriot missile artillery batteries and one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD missile defense system.</seg>
<seg id="6">THAAD, one of the world's most advanced missile systems, can target incoming missiles and blast them out of the sky. THAAD interceptors, fired from a truck-based launcher, use kinetic energy to deliver "hit to kill" strikes to ballistic threats.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Hoffman wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">President Donald Trump slammed Iran's alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, telling world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks.</seg>
<seg id="9">"All nations have a duty to act," Trump said regarding his call to counter Iranian behavior. "No responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust. As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Sept. 14 strikes on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. The drone attacks triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. While Tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks, it maintains that it was not involved.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.</seg>
<seg id="7">An example of a camouflage Ghillie suit the man used.</seg>
<seg id="8">When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream. Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="10">Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour. After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.</seg>
<seg id="11">The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="12">With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.</seg>

<seg id="1">No federal charges in fatal California police shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">Federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges Thursday against Sacramento police officers who fatally shot an unarmed black man, a killing that sparked protests and spurred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-year-old Stephon Clark found "insufficient evidence" to pursue charges against Officers Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet. Both will be returned to active duty.</seg>
<seg id="4">The California attorney general's office in March declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly yearlong investigation. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was advancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun. Investigators found only a cellphone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sacramento police also announced Thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it, we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar tragedies in the future," Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clark's brother, Stevante Clark, posted on Facebook Thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities. "These people have failed when it comes to (accountability)," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Authorities have said the officers believed Clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grandparents" backyard. The officers had been pursuing Clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor's sliding glass door.</seg>
<seg id="9">The officers shot Clark seven times as he approached them.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements, audio and video recordings, dispatch records, police reports, and autopsy reports to determine whether the officers acted willfully with the intent to use objectively unreasonable force.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lawmakers last month updated the nation's oldest law governing police use of deadly force, making it now among the country's most comprehensive when combined with additional training.</seg>
<seg id="12">California's old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and rarer still for them to be convicted. It was based on the doctrine of "reasonable fear," meaning if prosecutors or jurors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety, they could use lethal force.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will allow police to use deadly force only when "necessary" to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or bystanders.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.</seg>
<seg id="3">Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="5">The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor. But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.</seg>
<seg id="7">"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned. "If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest."</seg>
<seg id="8">Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants" expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it. The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president. He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February. His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.</seg>
<seg id="6">Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers.

<seg id="1">Google Marks Its 21st Birthday With a Doodle: All You Need to Know</seg>
<seg id="2">Google is marking its own birthday today with a doodle. The doodle features a photo of a 90s' style computer with Google search page and date stamp for September 27, 1998, surrounded by confetti in Google colours. A smaller doodle with number 21 as candles, as a part of Google logo, shows on the search results page. The search giant was founded 21 years ago in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University in California. September 27 is, however, not Google's actual birthday.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you take the company's incorporation date as its birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated the day as its birthday, at least not in the form of a doodle. Google celebrated September 7 as its birthday in doodles until 2005, following which it switched to September 27.</seg>
<seg id="4">Initially, the search engine was called "BackRub" and it was later renamed "Google."</seg>
<seg id="5">"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines," Sergey Brin and Lawrence (Larry) Page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a prototype of a "large-scale search engine."</seg>
<seg id="6">The company got its start thanks to Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company had raised a $25 million round from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins. Google moved to its Mountain View location in the same year, where it remains. In 2001, the company was granted a patent for its technology.</seg>
<seg id="7">What started out as a Web search engine has since turned into a massive conglomerate that calls itself Alphabet and Google is a subsidiary company. Today, Google operates all over the world in over 100 languages, answering trillions of search queries each year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do," Google writes on its Our Story page. "Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Although we've ditched the Lego servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very day.</seg>

<seg id="2">Iranian President Hassan Rouhani makes a speech during a ceremony in Tehran, Iran on January 10, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="3">Oil slid after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the U.S. offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations. President Donald Trump and the State Department later denied those claims, causing oil to rebound from the lows.</seg>
<seg id="4">WTI crude futures were last down by 0.9% to $55.91 after falling as low as $54.79. Brent crude futures dropped 1.4% to $61.89.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The German chancellor, the prime minister of England (Britain) and the president of France were in New York and all insisted that this meeting take place. And America says that it will lift the sanctions," Rouhani said on his official website, according to Reuters. "It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump later said he responded "of course, NO!" to Iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The State Department called the report "baseless," adding the U.S. is committed to zero oil exports from the Iranian regime, Bloomberg News said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rouhani's comment came after a series of drones attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 14, which had forced the kingdom to cut production in half. The U.S. and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, have blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran has denied any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region.</seg>
<seg id="9">The State Department didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="10">"There's been a big bearish risk from a thaw in the US Iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur," said John Kilduff of Again Capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's not just Iranian production and exports. Its' millions of barrels in floating storage and millions of barrels sitting in China's ports waiting to be processed by customs," Kilduff said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, was blamed by Washington for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Thursday, The Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, is engaged to her boyfriend, the 34-year old property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The Princess, who is ninth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Mr Mapelli Mozzi next year. The couple said in a statement: "We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness."</seg>
<seg id="4">Princess Beatrice's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, also shared their excitement.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Duchess of York wrote on Twitter: " I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great sons in law."</seg>
<seg id="7">The royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire Royal Family to get together, and hopefully completely repair Fergie's relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since Sarah was embroiled in one of the Royal Family's biggest ever scandals, her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult.</seg>
<seg id="9">Five months after announcing she was separating from Prince Andrew in 1992, compromising photographs of her with her "financial advisor" were taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez.</seg>
<seg id="10">The snaps appeared to show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess" toes and the arch of her foot, and Prince Philip in particular, is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daughter-in-law's scandalous antics.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, his behaviour was reportedly "appalling" towards the Duchess of York, and Princess Beatrice once claimed her mother was the victim of "mean spirited actions to make her feel unwelcome."</seg>
<seg id="12">JUST IN: Kate and William behind closed doors: Couple's shock habit exposed</seg>
<seg id="13">The report noted that the Duchess" spokesman was unable to comment on the claims, but a friend of Fergie was quoted as saying: "It is no secret that Sarah's daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the Royal Family.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty miserly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"They are constantly berating their father for allowing it to happen and Beatrice in particular has been imploring Prince Andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an outcast."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Next Big Labor Strike Hits Oregon</seg>
<seg id="2">The state university workers" most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work. The pay disparities alone are shocking. About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). Meanwhile, university presidents" annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million. While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, "I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve." Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: "I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise - a living wage."</seg>
<seg id="4">As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel. "There is an unwritten class system at the universities," Fulmer said. "And we are at the bottom of it."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Education workers have been under attack for decades," he continued. "We are finally standing up and fighting back. It's one thing to see classism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation. But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate."</seg>
<seg id="6">And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action. Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot. Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the healthcare sector, the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Permanente authorized a strike (with a 98 percent approval rate) if a deal isn't reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement. Elsewhere in the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, has been deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration; their last contract expired in May, and the clock is ticking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up," Burley explains. "This is a part of the national wave of labor growth. People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace."</seg>
<seg id="9">It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. Lord knows that something's gotta give.</seg>

<seg id="2">A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.</seg>
<seg id="3">It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="5">To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber</seg>
<seg id="7">Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.</seg>
<seg id="8">"As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."</seg>

<seg id="1">Setting the example? Income inequality in the US is at an all-time high</seg>
<seg id="2">Last year the income gap between richest and poorest people in the US stood at its highest level since 1967, the first year the Census Bureau started tracking it. DC and New York are among places where the differences are worst.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US may be the world's wealthiest nation, but it is also one where the super-rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on GoFundMe to pay their medical bills. The economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes, with the latter being at an all-time high.</seg>
<seg id="4">One way to measure income inequality is the Gini index. It measures between 0, a score for absolute equality and 1, which stands for a hypothetical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation. The Census Bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years. In 1967 it stood at 0.397 but, in 2018, it rose to 0.485, the highest figure on the record.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are nations with worse income inequalities, including some with reasonably strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimates that South Africa's Gini index stood at 0.63 in 2014 while Brazil's was 0.53 in 2017. By comparison, all EU countries have a Gini index below 0.4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentrated, including DC, New York and Connecticut, as well as in poverty-ridden areas like Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality.</seg>
<seg id="7">The census also showed a stagnating growth of median household income, which grew to over $62,000. It's the highest level ever measured by the American Community Survey, but the increase was just 0.8 from 2017 to 2018, much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amounting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new statistics will likely put some wind into the sails of progressive Democratic contenders for the party nomination for next year's presidential election, who call for leaning on the super-wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes.</seg>
<seg id="9">It may also undermine the rationale behind the current administration's corporate tax breaks, which were passed through Congress in 2017. The goal was to convince multinationals to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trickles down to the middle and poor classes. In practice, it seems, it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment. Well, someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips.</seg>

<seg id="15">He settled on the grovelling gift, thought to be a 911, after being urged to pull a "power move" by his rapper pal.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, pals said Tristan even won an invite from Khloe to a 'Taco Tuesday' dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a reunion with the reality star and their 17-month-old daughter True.</seg>

<seg id="2">A freezer malfunction at Children's Hospital Los Angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children's blood stem cells that were harvested at the beginning of each patient's oncology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families," the hospital wrote in a statement. "If you have not received a letter or phone call from our team, your child is not impacted."</seg>
<seg id="4">All but one patient had gone through initial therapy. That patient did require the recollection of stem cells, chief medical officer James Stein said.</seg>
<seg id="5">A letter sent to families earlier in September informing them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents. The hospital has also apologized to parents for the messaging oversight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hospital said that the loss of stem cells, which had been placed in long-term storage, has not jeopardized any child's health. The hospital has also offered to assist families who want to harvest again. But the process can be grueling.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the patients described it as "painful." Sean Anderson Corona, 13, underwent stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma - a cancer often found in the adrenal glands. The boy was hooked up to machines for a daylong process that collects the stem cells from the blood. The blood is then reinfused back into the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking, and then I just started to freak out and I'd start crying," Corona told ABC-7.</seg>
<seg id="9">Corona will be cancer-free for three years in November. But his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said that she worries that if his cancer does return, it may be impossible to harvest more stem cells from his blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stein said that the recollection of patients" stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient relapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We think that's going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn't ask anyone to do that in advance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The freezer has since been replaced, and the sensor-monitoring and alert system have been upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Obviously, this is a huge deal for us." Stein said. "We're reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered."</seg>

<seg id="2">It's day six of the Duke of Sussex' royal tour of Africa with his wife Meghan and baby Archie. But Friday morning, Harry returned to Angola alone to reconnect with the legacy of his late mother, Princess Diana.</seg>
<seg id="3">Diana's legacy was brought full circle when Harry donned the distinctive blue body armor of the HALO Trust. Twenty-two years ago, Diana took a similar path across an Angolan field scattered with deadly landmines, left over from years of civil war. It became one of the most iconic images of her short life.</seg>

<seg id="6">Over two decades later, the world is still not free of these devices. And echoing his mother, loud and clear, Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thomas Cook pension trustees plot deal to salvage payouts</seg>
<seg id="2">Thomas Cook's pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insurers about a deal to salvage the collapsed travel group's retirement scheme benefits.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sky News has learnt that Steve Southern, chair of the trustees, is holding talks with several parties about a buyout deal that would avoid most of Thomas Cook's 14,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments.</seg>
<seg id="4">Any deal with an insurer would be likely to involve a more modest cut to payouts than the 10% triggered by a pension scheme's transfer into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) lifeboat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the Thomas Cook schemes have been through an assessment by the PPF.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thomas Cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse</seg>
<seg id="7">That period could take up to two years, and if the schemes do enter the PPF will result in roughly 10,000 future pensioners having their payouts cut by 10%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sources said that a number of pension risk transfer specialists, as well as at least one of the new "superfund" consolidation vehicles, were in talks with Thomas Cook's trustees about a deal.</seg>
<seg id="9">News of the trustees' efforts to secure members' benefits comes four days after Britain's oldest tour operator ceased trading, sparking an international repatriation programme and triggering thousands of job losses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Cook's descent into insolvency has sparked a bitter blame game, with board members, government ministers and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company's four pension schemes are well-funded, with a £100m surplus on a PPF basis, according to the latest figures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Collectively, they hold assets worth about £1.5bn.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, as Sky News revealed last month, the trustees' demands for better terms in Thomas Cook's proposed rescue deal added a further complication to efforts to get the transaction across the line.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Cook's liquidation brought to an end 178 years of solvent trading, prompting the launch of inquiries by the government's Insolvency Service, the accounting watchdog and an influential committee of MPs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ministers have established a taskforce to address the crisis, which has left creditors facing meagre returns from the post-insolvency sale of assets.</seg>
<seg id="16">To date, just under half of Thomas Cook's overseas British customers have been flown home.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its collapse came hours after Thomas Cook issued a last-gasp plea to its lenders to reduce a £200m funding demand.</seg>
<seg id="18">What went so wrong for Thomas Cook?</seg>
<seg id="19">The talks, which concluded without a deal on Sunday evening, represented a frantic last throw of the dice for a company which had been forced to seek more than £1bn in new funding following a £1.5bn half-year loss and deteriorating trading.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old cabinet-maker and former Baptist preacher who began offering one-day rail excursions from Leicester to Loughborough for a shilling.</seg>
<seg id="21">From there, it went on to become one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversary three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="22">A PPF spokesperson said: "Insolvency events, like the liquidation of Thomas Cook, are exactly why the PPF was set up.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are here to protect the financial futures of members belonging to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them."</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokesman for Thomas Cook's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Baby Stella was welcomed into the world at Cotswold Wildlife Park, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Monty and Ruby.</seg>
<seg id="3">The youngster, who is healthy and nursing well, can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mother Ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park's first ever calf with Monty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nancy then gave birth to a female named Astrid in 2013, with Stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 49-year history.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jamie Craig, curator of Cotswold Wildlife Park, said: 'We have had tremendous success with our current rhino herd.</seg>
<seg id="7">'Stella is the sixth youngster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull, Monty, has proved to be an excellent dad.</seg>
<seg id="8">'He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patriarch.</seg>
<seg id="9">'It is particularly satisfying that Ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and Stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Ruby has had two boys before, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan is still at the park whilst Ian is in Torino Zoo in Italy</seg>
<seg id="11">When Alan was just one-week old he weighed around eleven stone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Births in captivity are considered extremely rare. Females only reproduce every two-and-a-half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the park, a typical gestation period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months, after which a single calf is born.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is considered the longest gestation periods of any land mammal, surpassed only by the twenty-two month gestation period of an Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="15">A newborn Rhino calf will stand up within one hour of birth. Once born, the calf will immediately attempt to suckle, although he or she may be a little unsteady on their feet for the first few days.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will remain under the watchful eye of the mother, suckling from her for approximately one year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their bond is an intensely strong one and the calf will remain with its mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection. Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.</seg>

<seg id="2">Footage has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alek Minassian, 26, said that he was part of the involuntary celibates (incel) forum on 4chan.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is now facing 10 counts of murder in Canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on April 23, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="5">When asked about the deaths, he told police: "I feel like I accomplished my mission."</seg>
<seg id="6">When the incident happened, it brought attention to the online world of loneliness, rage and misogyny.</seg>
<seg id="7">Minassian said that he had contact with a killer in California who was angry at women who had rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pedestrians in a busy north Toronto neighbourhood. Eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died.</seg>
<seg id="9">Minassian has yet to enter a plea. His trial begins in February, but a publication ban on his interrogation by police was lifted today. The police interview took place just hours after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">Minassian, who said he never had a girlfriend and was a virgin, acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: "I know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way," but added that they are "too cowardly to act on their anger."</seg>
<seg id="12">Minassian calls himself an "incel," short for "involuntary celibate." The incel movement is an online subculture linked to the deadly attack in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida. It promotes the misogynistic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over time, "incel" has become a buzzword for certain men infuriated at being rejected by women and prone to float ideas for violent payback, according to sociologists and others who study them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use "Chad" and "Stacy" as dismissive slang for men and women with more active sex lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">Minassian said he discussed his sexual frustrations on the website 4chan, which has become notorious as a place for extremists to post their views.</seg>

<seg id="2">The largest US independent theater chain won't let people in cosplay watch the critically acclaimed origin story of Batman supervillain "Joker." Face paint and masks are already banned, but safety fears still remain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most US cinemas have banned masks, face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which happened during a screening of another Batman flick, "The Dark Knight Rises." The gunman wore a Joker costume when he went on a gun and tear-gas rampage, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Body costumes that don't hide a person's identity, however, have been generally allowed in theaters.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Landmark Theaters has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear costumes during screenings of the R-rated "Joker."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I want customers to be comfortable in their surroundings," Landmark President-CEO Ted Mundorff told the Hollywood Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company is based in Los-Angeles and runs 52 theaters in 27 markets, which makes it the biggest specialized theater chain in the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, Kansas-based AMC Theatres, the largest chain in the country, reiterated its ban on "masks, face paint or any object that conceals the face," but said they will welcome viewers in costume.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons, but as the release of "Joker" draws closer, there are concerns that it may trigger a copycat gun attack. The LAPD said it would "maintain high visibility" around theaters on premier day, while Regal Cinemas, the second-largest chain in the country, said it was implementing security protocols developed "in collaboration with NATO."</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Army went as far as advising service members to watch out for "incels," disgruntled males who can't get a date, who supposedly idolize the Joker and may mimic his brutal ways.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Joker," which is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, is due to be released on October 4 in the US, and is expected to become a box office hit. It follows the descent of a socially isolated and mentally unwell person, as he becomes the mass-murdering, green-haired, pale-faced nemesis of Batman.</seg>
<seg id="11">It received rave reviews at its Venice International Film Festival premiere this year, taking the top prize. The film is a psychological thriller loosely based on the comic book series. Some commenters voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depicting the protagonist in a sympathetic way and including graphic and realistic violence. However, the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2">Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base as part of counteracting Russia's growing presence in the region, according to The Times, quoted by the FOCUS News Agency. Mikhail Koglignichanu Airbase, located about 200 km. east of Bucharest, will be aligned with NATO standards, as evidenced by documents published by local news sites. Up to 10,000 NATO F-35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommodated there. It is planned to become a "mini-city" for the military with kindergartens, sports clubs and a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="3">The base has already become a center of increased NATO activity in the Black Sea, which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea, using the deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria. Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.</seg>
<seg id="4">Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, which in the past were allies of the USSR, have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse. In response to Russia's actions, they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region, writes The Times. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. An Eurofighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets. Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast, is also concerned about Russia's aspirations. It is not a member of the alliance, but is involved in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was "preparing" Georgia for accession. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukraine, the "New Berlin Wall," Once Again Lies at the Center of Scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Poroshenko's eagerness to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would thwart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Giuliani to press Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, who has since been fired, to help Mr. Trump's own re-election by investigating Joe Biden and his son.</seg>
<seg id="3">How Mr. Poroshenko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sagging fortunes ahead of Ukraine's presidential election, held in two rounds in March and April this year, is unclear. He got trounced anyway, losing emphatically to Mr. Zelensky, whose own officials quickly became the Trump team's new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Democrats want Mr. Trump impeached over his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have counterattacked with their own Ukraine-focused scandals. They have revived a debunked theory that the country colluded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump's chances in 2016 and asserted, with little evidence, that Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ukrainians, jaded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain, have mostly shrugged off what, for Mr. Trump, is possibly the most serious scandal to buffet the White House since Watergate toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974.</seg>
<seg id="6">That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly bemusement in Ukraine. Those feelings are also tinged with a touch of pride that, after centuries in the shadow of Russia, its giant neighbor to the north, the nation is no longer seen as a backwater but a pivot around which the fate of the world's most powerful country implausibly turns.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister under Mr. Poroshenko, said in a caustic Twitter message this week that going down in history "as the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president" was "not a very fun prospect." But, he added, "Now everyone understands what we are capable of."</seg>

<seg id="1">Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing</seg>
<seg id="2">Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."</seg>
<seg id="4">Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested. Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."</seg>
<seg id="6">His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He is innocent. She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="12">The killings are usually carried out by a close relative. Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="13">Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="17">International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.</seg>
<seg id="19">She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.</seg>

<seg id="2">Using the Subaru, Keck, and Gemini Telescopes, an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.0 billion years ago. This is the earliest protocluster ever found. One of the 12 galaxies is a giant object, known as Himiko, which was discovered a decade ago by the Subaru Telescope and named for a mythological queen in ancient Japan. This discovery suggests that large structures such as protoclusters already existed when the Universe was only about 800 million years old, 6 percent of its present age.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the present Universe, galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members, but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy. To understand the formation of clusters, astronomers search for possible progenitors in the ancient Universe. A protocluster is a dense system of dozens of galaxies in the early Universe, growing into a cluster.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yuichi Harikane, a JSPS fellow at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who led the team of astronomers explains, "A protocluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high density, and not easy to find. To overcome this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Subaru Telescope to map a large area of the sky and look for protoclusters."</seg>
<seg id="5">In the map of the Universe made by the Subaru Telescope, the team discovered a protocluster candidate, z66OD, where galaxies are 15 times more concentrated than normal for that era. The team then conducted follow-up spectroscopic observations using the W.M. Keck Observatory and Gemini North telescope, and confirmed 12 galaxies which existed 13.0 billion years ago, making it the earliest protocluster known to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas, known as Himiko, which was found previously by the Subaru Telescope in 2009. "It is reasonable to find a protocluster near a massive object, such as Himiko. However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center." said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, "It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center. These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies."</seg>

<seg id="2">When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) purchased drinks from two girls running a lemonade stand in August, she may not have been aware that her $10 purchase would be donated to a pro-life charity.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our daughters thought [Warren] was nice," Dan Michels, a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls, told the Washington Free Beacon. "She came by and told us we should vote for her. And our daughters told us she was a nice person, but we don't align with her politically and ... because she's pro-choice, we said we should donate her money to a pro-life [cause]."</seg>
<seg id="4">On August 8, Warren stopped by a lemonade stand staffed by two 11-year-old children, Sienna Michels and Audrey Billings, during a campaign bus tour across Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!" Warren said on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person. The Michels girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op. The parents instead explained Warren's stance on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a non-profit that supports pro-life legislation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her," Michels said. "We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why viruses like Herpes and Zika will need to be reclassified: Biotech impact</seg>
<seg id="2">New research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be retooled, because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood. The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified, our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the 1950s and '60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses, they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus' genetic material. The majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasi-spherical and display icosahedral symmetry -- like a 20-sided dice for instance.</seg>
<seg id="4">The capsid shell is what protects them, and as scientists discovered their structure, they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome, and therefore could infect hosts differently.</seg>
<seg id="5">Why this matters</seg>
<seg id="6">When designing drugs to target viruses, scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two researchers who study the structures of viruses, Antoni Luque, a theoretical biophysicist at San Diego State University and a member of its Viral Information Institute, and Reidun Twarock, a mathematical biologist from the University of York, UK, and a member of York's Cross-disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis, show that many viruses have essentially been misclassified for 60 years, including common viruses such as Herpes simplex and Zika.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was because despite having the structural images from cryo-electron microscopy, we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruses.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells," Luque said. "So, many viruses don't adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures. There are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designed."</seg>
<seg id="10">They used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsid.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their study, which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage, based on the protein that they're composed of, adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts, providing a new approach to study virus evolution.</seg>
<seg id="12">Biotech applications</seg>
<seg id="13">Structural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses, which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications, and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid. This can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid, to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell, or break it apart after it's formed," Luque said. "This could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layout."</seg>
<seg id="16">This new framework accommodates viruses that were previously outliers, provides new predictions of viral capsid architectures, and has identified common geometrical patterns among distant evolutionary related viruses that infect everyone from humans to bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="17">Twarock said the new blueprints also provide "a new perspective on viral evolution, suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evolutionary timescales."</seg>
<seg id="18">Architectural applications</seg>
<seg id="19">The geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since the 1960s, these viral capsids have been classified using the geometrical framework introduced by structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Klug, which were inspired by the geodesic domes designed by the renowned architect R. Buckminster Fuller. However, as molecular imaging techniques have advanced, an increasing number of 3D viral capsid reconstructions that included viruses like Herpes or Zika have fallen out from this classical geometrical framework.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This study introduces a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Klug construction. It is based on the conservation of the local vertices formed by the proteins that interact in the capsid," Luque explained. "This approach led to the discovery of six new types of icosahedral capsid layouts, while recovering the two classical layouts from Caspar-Klug based on Goldberg and geodesic polyhedra."</seg>

<seg id="1">Having Too Much Of This Spice Could Damage Liver</seg>
<seg id="2">Made from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree, cinnamon is a widely popular spice, earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a flavor itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">And all for good reason since the spice is host to some very impressive health benefits, such as lowering the risk of life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and even diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="4">But hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful, very harmful. And in this case, here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much cinnamon. Stay safe out there.</seg>
<seg id="5">May increase the risk of cancer - Unfortunately, while cinnamon can help lower the risk of cancer, it can also very much contribute to the development of it. Per animal studies, consuming too much coumarin, which is commonly found in Cassia cinnamon, may increase the risk of cancer development. Per scientists, coumarin does this by supposedly damaging our DNAs over time.</seg>
<seg id="6">May cause liver damage - Per studies, too much coumarin can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage. This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">May cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores. This is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts, can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies. However, one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when they're allergic from it.</seg>
<seg id="8">May cause breathing problems - This is more of a general precaution since cinnamon's fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritant.</seg>
<seg id="9">May cause low blood sugar - For many people, cinnamon is helpful since it's well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar. This is good, especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar. However, too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low, posing a new set of health risks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tennessee's abortion waiting period trial goes to judge</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over the course of a four-day trial in Nashville that concluded Thursday, the state tried to show that the law, which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart, benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions. Attorneys representing five of the state's seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant burdens.</seg>
<seg id="4">Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period would make any difference for those women.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Thursday, attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 72-hour waiting period there. It found that 8% of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Questioned about the study, Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco, agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with. But she noted that the study did not find that Utah's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women.</seg>
<seg id="7">Biggs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems. She said a national study comparing women seeking abortions who were just under the cutoff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cutoff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-traumatic stress.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under cross-examination Biggs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion, although there were only three women like that identified in the study. She rebutted testimony from earlier in the week by Priscilla Coleman, a psychology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="9">Coleman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abortions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thursday also included testimony for the state from a Memphis obstetrician and gynecologist who participates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abortion-inducing medication. Dr. Michael Podraza said that through that work he has "personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tennessee's waiting period law went into effect in mid-2015, and Podraza said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway. Some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion, he testified. These reversals happened in spite of the waiting period.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hardship and stress. They also said the two-visit requirement poses logistical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abortions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law, pushing some women into surgical abortions, which have greater risks of complications. A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.</seg>
<seg id="14">In determining whether Tennessee's waiting period violates the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge Bernard Freidman must determine whether it places an undue burden on women seeking abortion. It's a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others upheld, depending on the specific circumstances of the state.</seg>
<seg id="15">After both sides rested their cases on Thursday, Friedman said he would rule as quickly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2">Investments in liquefied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all-time high of $50 billion, the International Energy Agency's head, Fatih Birol, told an industry conference.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This year, 2019 already broke the highest amount of (final investment decisions) for the first time ever, $50 billion," Birol told the LNG Producer-Consumer conference in Tokyo, as quoted by Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unsurprisingly, the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia, with China still expected to overtake Japan as the world's top importer of LNG.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The biggest growth is coming from China. In the next five years, about one-third of global LNG demand will come from China alone," Birol said. He added that in five years, China will become the largest importer of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="6">As for the growth in investments, there are no surprises there, either. The bulk of these has been made in the United States and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States" LNG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.9 billion cu ft daily. This will make the US the third-largest exporter of LNG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, US LNG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily, from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Canada, there is just one LNG project under development right now - LNG Canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually. The US$31-billion project is led by Shell, with minority participants including Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi, and Kogas.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its number-one spot in the global LNG export race. The country has lifted a moratorium on new drilling in its North Field - the world's largest offshore gas field Qatar shares with Iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Sees Frustrating Trend As Suicides Spike</seg>
<seg id="2">Military suicides surged this year to a record high among active duty troops, continuing a deadly trend that Pentagon officials say is frustrating and they are struggling to counter.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Army, Navy and Marine Corps all saw the rate of suicides go up as well as the overall numbers, with only the Air Force showing a decrease, according to data released by the Pentagon Thursday. Suicides among members of the Reserves and the National Guard also grew.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent suicides were underscored earlier this month when the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the USS George H.W. Bush took their own lives within a week.</seg>
<seg id="5">Asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, "I wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further, future suicides in the Armed Services. We don't. We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth."</seg>
<seg id="6">The number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. Army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the Marines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68. The Air Force dipped from 63 to 60.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Our numbers are not moving in the right direction," said Elizabeth Van Winkle, director of the Pentagon's office of force resiliency. She said that most of the military rates are comparable to civilians, but added, "that's hardly comforting."</seg>
<seg id="8">Military and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. Van Winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="9">She and Karen Orvis, director of the suicide prevention office, said recognizing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult, and that sometimes suicide is a sudden, impulsive decision with little warning. They said it's difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many stresses that could contribute.</seg>
<seg id="10">They also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help, because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clearances. And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived roadblocks.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Just as we talk about physical fitness, marksmanship, training and education, Marines must also be comfortable discussing life's struggles, mental wellness and suicide," said Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps. "We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal, important decisions Marines and sailors make."</seg>
<seg id="12">This year for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics for suicides by military spouses and dependents. Van Winkle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017, but officials are working to get better at collecting family data.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the report, there were 186 families that had suicides - 123 were spouses and 63 were dependents between the ages of 12 and 23.</seg>
<seg id="14">The vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 percent of the dependent suicides were males. About half of the dependents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and, for those younger than that, most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Late Night" host Seth Meyers on Thursday brought a moment of levity to an otherwise strained week marred by mass shootings when he cracked a gag about President Donald Trump and then couldn't stop laughing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comedian noted how Trump had visited the El Paso, Texas, hospital where victims of the weekend's mass shooting are being treated while his campaign still owed the city more than half a million dollars for a political rally in February.</seg>
<seg id="4">The campaign also incurred a one-time late fee over its failure to pay on time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That's so him," said Meyers. "I'm surprised his Oval Office desk isn't covered in unreturned Blockbuster DVDs."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then began mimicking Trump with a riff on hit 1989 movie "Tango & Cash," but soon descended into a fit of the giggles.</seg>

<seg id="2">As Lady Gaga once sang in her 2008 hit "Bad Romance": "Walk, walk, fashion, baby."</seg>
<seg id="3">One model took those words to heart and "murdered" the runway, according to one editor, while closing Maison Margiela's spring 2020 collection by John Galliano at Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Model Leon Dame, 20, strutted down the catwalk like no one has strutted before, powerfully putting one foot in front of the other and stomping down the runway, while keeping an intense, steely glare intact.</seg>
<seg id="5">His walk, paired with his belted top, white shorts, knee-high boots and cadet hat, quickly took the internet by storm. In one video of his walk, it appears he even got a smile out of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as he passed by her.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many praised the young German model, who has appeared in campaigns for Jil Sander, Fay and Solid Homme, for his distinctive swagger.</seg>
<seg id="7">Actor and "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Lisa Rinna described Leon as her "spirit animal," and fashion designer and singer Rihanna followed him on Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This video and this exit take the cake," one fan wrote on Leon's page after the model posted a video of his walk. "Crushhh leon" another added, while makeup artist and mogul Pat McGrath ― who did the makeup for the show ― left him lightning and fire emojis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perhaps the highest praise came from Tim Blanks, editor-at-large of the fashion site The Business of Fashion.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!" Blanks wrote in an Instagram caption on Wednesday, quoting the film "42nd Street."</seg>

<seg id="2">Looks like there will be a homecoming of sorts for Spider-Man, now that Disney and Sony have settled their differences.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two studios announced on Friday that they will collaborate on a third Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland.</seg>
<seg id="4">The as yet untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, and be produced by the Disney-owned Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, according to a press release sent by both studios.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amy Pascal will also produce through Pascal Pictures, as she has on the first two Holland-led films, the release said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am thrilled that Spidey's journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it," Feige said in the release. "Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe."</seg>
<seg id="7">The agreement also allows Spidey to appear in a future Marvel Studios film.</seg>
<seg id="8">Feige acknowledged the collaboration makes the webslinger unique among superheroes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"[Spider-Man] happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end to the Spidey standoff came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films, "Homecoming" and "Far From Home."</seg>
<seg id="11">The sticking point was that Disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co-financing stake in future films with Sony, which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the Mouse bought Marvel in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hollywood Reporter notes both sides had good reason to come together. "Far From Home" is Sony's biggest box office hit ever, while Marvel gets to maximize merchandising and keep creative control.</seg>
<seg id="13">One person who was happy the impasse has ended was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU, British negotiators work toward Brexit deal in Belgium</seg>
<seg id="2">The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator began talks With British officials in Belgium Friday to work toward an agreement, with about a month remaining before the departure deadline.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michel Barnier met with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay in Brussels, who was adamant the Irish "backstop" be stripped from any deal. The backstop, effectively an assurance of a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain leaves, has been perhaps the chief obstacle in negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Barclay said Britain is committed to finding a deal, he said there isn't much time left.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The deadline to leave the EU is Oct. 31, but a new British law prevents Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement, or Parliament's approval to leave without one by Oct. 19.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last week, EU negotiators said they are open to an alternative to the backstop -- but Irish deputy Simon Coveney said Friday London hasn't yet submitted a "serious" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Until there is a serious proposal, which can be the basis of negotiations, then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that "time is running out" and "the onus is on the British prime minister and his team" to put serious proposals on the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson's office said Friday there are still "significant obstacles" to a deal.</seg>
<seg id="11">"From an Irish perspective, we of course think that an extension is preferable to a no-deal," Coveney said. "But I think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension."</seg>
<seg id="12">EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail, it's Britain's fault.</seg>
<seg id="13">Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he's not optimistic about a deal, but urged British leaders to present a plan at a Brexit summit on Oct. 17.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty," he said. "It's not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night."</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.</seg>
<seg id="3">An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them. But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes. In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately. This is why the have a reddish color," Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit. Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.</seg>
<seg id="13">A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said. "This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear. These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet."</seg>

<seg id="2">Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader's agenda at the United Nations this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Fridays for Future movement that began as a lone demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thunbergjust over a year ago has mushroomed, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yorkand attracting attention in developing nations across Africa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country. There were also marches in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India, among other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York, which included a scathing speech by Thunbergto world leaders reprimanding them for inaction.</seg>
<seg id="6">"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she said on Tuesday. "The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Citing a U.N.-backed reportreleased last year, demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees, which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walkouts until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Nigeria's capital Abuja, Oladosu Adenike marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday. The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages, "Climate change is real" and "We don't have time."</seg>
<seg id="10">In Lausanne, Switzerland, where hundreds of climate strike organizers gatheredin August planning for this week's events, thousands of people marched through the city, according to local reports.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where local media reportedthat the city's school would allow students to participate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thunberg, who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N., was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal, Canada.</seg>

<seg id="2">Serena Williams, tennis legend and seven-time Wimbledon champion, is being fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice courts with her racquet.</seg>
<seg id="3">The All England Club, which hosts the Wimbledon tournament, handed the fine to Williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on June 30, according to The Associated Press and CNN.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 37-year-old tennis star appeared to shrug off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarterfinal round against Alison Riske on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I haven't really thought about it, to be honest," she said when asked about the fine. "I just threw my racquet. I got fined."</seg>
<seg id="6">Williams said she didn't know how that could've caused damage.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I mean, I guess if you could tell me, I would appreciate it," she told reporters. "I mean, I have always been an Avenger in my heart. Maybe I'm super strong. I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="8">Williams is after her eighth Wimbledon title, which would be her 24th grand slam victory. She is advancing to the singles semifinals on Thursday against Czech player Barbora Strýcová.</seg>
<seg id="9">Williams was also fined a total of $17,000 last year after she defended herself against an umpire at the U.S. Open who accused her of illegally communicating with her coach during a match.</seg>
<seg id="10">During that incident, the umpire issued three code violations to Williams: One for receiving illegal coaching, a second for breaking her tennis racket in frustration and a third after she confronted the umpire and called him a "thief."</seg>
<seg id="11">Many of Williams" fans claimed that the umpire was unnecessarily harsh in his response to her, especially considering male players" meltdowns throughout the history of the sport.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that?" Williams told U.S. Open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the umpire.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams wasn't the only one who received a fine at this year's Wimbledon, though hers was the most costly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Italian player Fabio Fognini was fined $3,000 for saying a "bomb should explode" at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to U.S. player Tennys Sandgren on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="7">When he returned, Townsend said: "I'm really, really sorry. Roger cannot actually speak now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Apparently, before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he's been singing so f***ing great through this tour. I don't know what the f*** is going on. He has been on top of his game.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight... I don't think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is Roger's show and he's not in good shape."</seg>
<seg id="10">The crowd was completely supportive, cheering the 74-year-old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Townsend said; "We will publish a date for our return as soon as we can. Let me explain one thing... We only do one day on, one day off. This is because Roger's vocal surgeon insists he has a day off...</seg>

<seg id="2">Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.</seg>
<seg id="6">During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">'We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.'</seg>
<seg id="9">She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.</seg>
<seg id="10">Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.</seg>
<seg id="11">'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.</seg>
<seg id="12">'That you have to be true to who you are.'</seg>
<seg id="13">She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.</seg>
<seg id="14">'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.</seg>
<seg id="15">'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.</seg>
<seg id="16">'A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting. She made it easy. She is an easy-going royal.'</seg>
<seg id="17">Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.</seg>
<seg id="18">Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now. Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby, my goodness it's a lot, but it's all so exciting.</seg>
<seg id="19">'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'</seg>
<seg id="20">Meghan then went to the city's Mothers2Mothers organisation, which trains and employs women with HIV.</seg>

Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the British government's "reasonable worst-case" scenario, the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was "extremely limited" if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report also said there was "incomplete information" about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the event of a no-deal exit, the department (of health) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task," the watchdog wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings "deeply concerning." She said she had seen "countless examples" of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"If the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dr. Richard Torbett of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit, "some things are outside of their control."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said more details were needed on how companies might access government-planned freight capacity if Britain sees a no-deal departure from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Securing a (Brexit) deal remains the best way to protect patients," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cleveland police branded 'failing' in all areas by inspectors</seg>
<seg id="2">Scandal-hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded "failing" in all areas by inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="3">It has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which scrutinised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe, operate efficiently, as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce.</seg>
<seg id="4">The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures, where the chief constable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure "critical improvements" are made.</seg>
<seg id="5">The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made.</seg>
<seg id="6">A string of scandals has plagued the force, covering Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north east of England.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has seen six chief constables in almost as many years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former chief constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012; seven officers were under investigation after journalists" phones were unlawfully monitored, and there have been long-standing claims of racism within the ranks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of constabulary as being about as "inefficient as you can possibly imagine," with officers having to share laptops and bodyworn cameras.</seg>
<seg id="10">HM Inspector of Constabulary Phil Gormley said it was a "failing force" where there had been "significant" deterioration in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said the report described the "worst findings ever into any police force in the country" which was "finally the official validation" that the force is "broken" and said the Home Office needed to intervene now.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "It's no longer in dispute. It is a fact described in black and white in this report.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The findings are some of the most distressing and shocking I have ever read."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors, and the only one rated inadequate in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gormley added: "The force doesn't appropriately prioritise crime prevention. There is a lack of strategic direction, and the force doesn't allocate enough resources to prevention work ... It is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people, including children. It is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk."</seg>
<seg id="16">He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating "ethical behaviour," and the "inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "It doesn't consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce; its processes aren't perceived to be fair and it doesn't understand its workforce well enough to support them."</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite the findings, the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tackles serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The force's police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger said: "I am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The force's recent performance is simply not good enough."</seg>
<seg id="21">He said he had received assurances from the current chief constable Richard Lewis that "swift action" was taken as soon as he became aware of the failings.</seg>
<seg id="22">Coppinger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lewis said the report would act "as a line in the sand" for the force, adding: "Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed. In the five months I've been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff, at all levels, and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers."</seg>
<seg id="24">If drastic improvements are not made quickly enough, the Government could step in, as it can when prisons are failing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces, inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kit Malthouse, minister for crime, policing and fire, said he welcomed the chief constable's "swift action to address these failings and will be monitoring the position closely," adding: "Transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing.</seg>

<seg id="2">A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks. The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="3">Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up. "They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.' They called me 'an attention-seeker.'"</seg>
<seg id="5">According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different. She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother. "I want to see them dismissed from the school. I want to see something done."</seg>
<seg id="10">Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement. "We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can. We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police."</seg>
<seg id="12">While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her. She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.</seg>
<seg id="13">Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Iran released a British-flagged oil tanker on Friday, two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law.</seg>
<seg id="3">Iranian Ports and Maritime Administration confirmed that the vessel, Stena Impero, left Bandar Abbas port at 9 a.m., the state-run IRNA reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Erik Hanell, president and CEO of Stena Bulk, the operator of the ship, also confirmed the ship's release.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirm the Stena Impero and its crew have been released," he said via Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ship was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on July 19 for having violated international maritime law when it allegedly veered into Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vessel's seizure, however, was widely seen as retaliatory for British forces capturing a tanker off Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. The ship was released in mid-August despite the Trump administration making a last-ditch attempt to length its detention.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Stena Impero was officially given permission to leave on Monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship's conduct completed, the New York Times reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The vessel has left the port of Bandar Abbas and is transiting to Dubai for the crew to disembark and receive medical checks and debriefing," Hanell said. "The families of crew members have been informed and the Company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seafarers at the earliest possible opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="10">The ship became victim to escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf where both the United States and Iran shot down the other's drone and at least two tankers were sabotaged by explosives, which the Trump administration has blamed Iran for.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Trump administration most recently blamed Iran for drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which Tehran denies having any involvement with.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-test kit aimed at empowering citizens, especially men to carry out HIV testing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV/Aids infections by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">The oral HIV test kit dubbed, OraQuick HIV self-test, a product of Orasure technologies, targets young people aged 18 to 24 years, men and priority populations such as sex workers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years. For the young people that's the age bracket we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it's because we do not have evidence of children by the Constitution but as more evidence unfolds we are going to get there. For the men, we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner, key and priority populations such sex workers," Mr Geoffrey Tasi, the technical officer-in-charge of HIV testing services, said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Easy use</seg>
<seg id="7">Initially, the self-test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the HIV, however, with oral HIV self-test kit, oral fluids are involved.</seg>
<seg id="8">The test works by detecting antibodies, the body's natural defenders against infection. If one is infected with HIV, these antibodies will be present in your blood and also in the salivia. The test will detect the antibodies in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Data by the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) shows that Uganda is registering 1,000 new HIV/Aids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week, translating into 53,000 new infections and 23,000 deaths annually.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr Diana Atwine, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, said this is timely and will enhance the fight against HIV/Aids.</seg>
<seg id="11">She, however, urged the men to take HIV testing as an important issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">She added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people, who are living with HIV but do not know their HIV status.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Currently, 86 per cent people living with HIV know their status; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with HIV and do not know their status. So how do we now utilise that additional innovation. Really for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand, especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care," Dr Atwine said.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Tasi said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dr Atwine said apart from graphics and videos provided to educate the users, there should be toll free numbers always available to offer counselling in both government and private facilities, including all pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Research. According to the research, OraQuick HIV self-test detected more than 99 per cent of people, who were infected with HIV and people, who were not infected with HIV.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some competitors at the world athletics championships that began on Friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent: the sweltering Qatari heat.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its suffocating humidity and daytime temperatures hovering around 38 degrees Celsius, Doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athletics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minimize the heat's harmful effects.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the Khalifa International Stadium, where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cooling system, they have still had to adjust their training because they practise at an outdoor facility.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are from a hot climate as well, but nothing to compare with this," Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Here you walk outside and it's like somebody put a heater on you. I guess that is why they are doing it at night."</seg>
<seg id="8">Athletics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race walkers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The IAAF, the global governing body of athletics, said the women's marathon, scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">It said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams "to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk."</seg>
<seg id="11">Track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances, but conceded that practices have been especially draining.</seg>
<seg id="12">"At practice I'm glowing because I'm sweating because it's so humid," said Rai Benjamin, who competes in the 400m hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's like I got out of the shower. But I don't think it will be that bad because of the cooling system."</seg>
<seg id="14">Shot putter Ryan Crouser, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the sizzling heat and high humidity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The shot is far below the dew point, the instant you take it out, it's just soaking wet and it's dripping water," the American said. "It's worse than if it was pouring down rain... We've been fighting this a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="16">European pole vault champion Armand Duplantis, who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana, said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chalk on his hands "makes for a really nice grip."</seg>
<seg id="17">But other pole vaulters who spray a sticky grip enhancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity, he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"For people who use sticky spray, I can see it being a problem because it can get a little slimy and gooey," Duplantis said.</seg>

<seg id="3">HMP Wandsworth called in police amid fears that duplicates had been sold to some of its 1,400 inmates.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced, potentially to cell, internal and outer doors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police arrested a 40-year-old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on September 13. The man, from South West London, was working for the Government Facility Services Ltd, which maintains 52 jails across the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police investigation has raised concerns that imprints of some of the keys may have been taken in clay before actual copies were produced.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wandsworth Prison is a Category B jail in South West London which can house up to 1,628 prisoners, making it one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. The jail, built in 1851, holds convicted male criminals and those on remand awaiting trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "HMP Wandsworth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident. It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing."</seg>

<seg id="2">"The President's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry. We condemn the President's attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers," they said. "Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security."</seg>
<seg id="3">The statement said Trump "is fully aware that our Committees are seeking testimony from this whistleblower and others referenced in the whistleblower's complaint released today as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, and our nation's laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress."</seg>
<seg id="4">"No officials with knowledge relevant to the committees' investigation, including knowledge of the subject of the whistleblower complaint, may be subject to any intimidation, reprisal, or threat of reprisal, and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony," they added.</seg>
<seg id="5">The statement on Thursday comes amidst an explosive week in Washington rooted in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump abused his official powers "to solicit interference" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. A transcript of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited. In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside."</seg>
<seg id="9">Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said. "So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything."</seg>
<seg id="11">She continued:</seg>
<seg id="12">I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.</seg>

<seg id="2">BOSTON (Reuters) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offerings for the rest of the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The surprise postponement of the WeWork IPO has underscored how confidence is eroding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors.</seg>
<seg id="4">A more discerning market for initial public offerings continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O on Friday, a day after it began trading, as shares of the fitness startup fell 4% to $24.74. The company is now trading 15% below its Wednesday IPO price.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the past, public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO. This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-growing revenue to their portfolios.</seg>
<seg id="6">Recent deals, however, suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about the loss-making companies they are willing to back.</seg>
<seg id="7">Peloton reported rapid top-line growth of 110% during the fiscal year that ended June 30. But the company also showed negative operating leverage, with operating expenses surging 147% over the prior year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Loss-making teeth-alignment company SmileDirectClub SDC.O earlier this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.</seg>
<seg id="9">The average IPO return in 2019 is now about 9%, down from more than 30% at the end of June and more than 18% about two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the United States, much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fruition - the planned IPO of WeWork parent We Company.</seg>
<seg id="11">Having aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September, the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019, before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public.</seg>
<seg id="12">Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel with a track record of losses, made a last-minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions. Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses. "It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say, "these were isolated and not comparable," or say "we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm PwC. The market was more receptive to lesser-known names such as cyber security company Ping Identity PING.N and cloud monitoring company Datadog Inc DDOG.O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Queer Eye" star Jonathan Van Ness strutted his stuff on Capitol Hill on Thursday, joining forces with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to discuss the Equality Act.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Equality Act would extend nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals in credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury service and public accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Van Ness, who recently publicly came out as HIV positive, first shared a video of himself cat-walking in the Capitol, explaining in his caption that he'd met with the House speaker to talk Equality Act, living with HIV and access to PrEP (an HIV preventative medication):</seg>

<seg id="2">David Attenborough is 93-years-old but the iconic nature guru is not slowing down just yet.</seg>
<seg id="3">No, after the success of his groundbreaking Netflix documentary Our Planet, the much loved star is set to return with another series: Life In Colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">This time, the father-of-two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-tech cameras that were built especially for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="5">The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show "a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes" - and it sounds truly fascinating.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, despite fans being eager for the upcoming release, it seems we all need to sit tight as it won't be dropping on our screens until 2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">But we're sure it'll be worth the wait.</seg>
<seg id="8">Earlier this month, David was presented with the TV Choice Lifetime Achievement Award, at the prestigious ceremony in London.</seg>
<seg id="9">The national treasure has entertained millions over his career, which has so far spanned 60 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">When collecting his gong, the reporter enthused: "Indeed. What I do isn't always entertaining, and sometimes people hear things they don't like!</seg>
<seg id="11">"But this is an honour and a great pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="12">TV Choice said of the winner: "Still working, learning and making programmes Sir David Attenborough isn't just a British hero, he's a global icon."</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, David was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him.</seg>
<seg id="14">The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the naming ceremony in Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "It's no news to any of you that the world is facing great, great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today, who will inherit this world.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That's what this astonishing ship will be here to do, to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="18">Life In Colour is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while it's said Netflix will retain global rights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Don't use my wife's name to score points, says husband of murdered MP Jo Cox</seg>
<seg id="2">The husband of Jo Cox said his wife's name must not be used to score political points after Jeremy Corbyn last night posted footage of the murdered MP to criticise Boris Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Labour leader's film featured clips of Mrs Cox and a vigil held after her death, with the caption: "Boris Johnson does not care about violence on our streets."</seg>
<seg id="4">Critics said Mr Corbyn was using her murder to score "cheap political points" while her husband Brendan Cox said the Labour leader was "wrong" to infer hateful language was a "simple party political issue."</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Cox said: "Jeremy is right that the best way to honour Jo is to defeat hatred and division. He's also right the PM has a particular responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="6">"But he's wrong to infer this is a simple party political issue. Jo was passionately Labour but some things must transcend party politics."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also shared a post which said Jo Cox's name was "more than a political scoring point" with the caption "This. Thank you." Mr Corbyn was facing a backlash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Cox's murder three years ago by a far-Right activist in her West Yorkshire constituency.</seg>
<seg id="8">Speaking over a montage of clips of Mrs Cox, Mr Johnson and female MPs, Mr Corbyn said: "This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences. He wants division. Clearly, he doesn't care about the violence on our streets."</seg>
<seg id="9">He goes on to criticise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Corbyn added: "Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Boris Johnson, language which is being repeated by the far-Right. When this was raised with him by women MPs, who themselves face death threats, he arrogantly dismissed them. It was nothing short of disgraceful." Former Labour MP John Woodcock shared the video and said: "You can really shut up. Disgusting."</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile Tory MP and business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "You are so wrong to use Jo Cox in this way, when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way. To be kept out of politics.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If you have an ounce of decency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down." It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the "best way" to honour Mrs Cox was to "get Brexit done." Her sister Kim Leadbeater called for a dialling down of extreme language saying it was "not helpful to Jo's kids."</seg>
<seg id="13">She told ITV: "For me to come out and say outrageous things about Boris Johnson - I just don't think that's a useful way of moving forward. I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I'm going to try and do that in a measured manner."</seg>
<seg id="14">The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother's life because of the way people speak about politicians.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brazil's environmental agency Ibama said on Thursday that an analysis of a vast oil spill along the country's northeastern beaches showed the spilled crude did not originate in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ibama said in a statement that it had been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since Sept. 2. Local media showed pictures of sea turtles coated in black tar by the slick.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spill spans over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of Brazil's northeast coast, affecting wildlife and polluting some of the postcard beaches in one of the nation's top touristic destinations, such as Praia do Futuro, in the state of Ceara, and Maragogi, in Alagoas state.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said in a statement that it had concluded after a molecular analysis of the oil that the crude spilled was not produced nor sold by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6">Crude oil is tested before export to make sure it complies with the standards of the refinery it is being shipped to. Crude oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical signatures, including levels of sulfur and nitrogen, acidity and viscosity.</seg>
<seg id="7">The head of Brazil's oil agency ANP Decio Oddone said the agency believes the oil could have been spilled by a tanker transporting the crude far from the Brazilian coast, but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet. An ANP statement said there were no reports of spills by any operator of oil drilling rigs in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some marine turtles were contaminated by the oil. They were rescued alive in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and sent to rehabilitation centers. Other animals were found dead, Ibama said, without disclosing species or numbers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Petrobras, as the state oil company is known, said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the spill it was contributing to the clean-up efforts, with some 100 Petrobras employees helping clean the beaches.</seg>

<seg id="1">Skoda to provide drivers with voice activated digital assistant</seg>
<seg id="2">Skoda is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activated with a verbal command. In an announcement Wednesday, the Czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activated by the phrase "Okay, Laura."</seg>
<seg id="3">The system, which supports six languages, is able to undertake a range of tasks including starting navigation to a destination and searching for music. It will initially be available in models of the Kamiq city SUV and the compact Scala. Part of the Volkswagen Group since 1991, the Skoda brand delivered 1.25 million vehicles globally in 2018, according to its annual report.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company's introduction of a virtual, voice activated assistant mirrors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector. Some BMW cars, for instance, are now equipped with an "intelligent personal assistant" which can be activated by using a button, a personal activation word or the phrase "Hello, BMW." Verbal commands can be used to, among other things, activate seat heating, get information on tire pressure, and adjust the in-car temperature.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle," Jack Palmer, a senior connected car specialist at SBD Automotive, said in a statement sent to CNBC via email on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"If the lion's share of commands from the driver can be inputted through virtual assistants, rather than fiddling around with touchscreens and buttons, the current epidemic of driver distraction will be greatly mitigated," Palmer added. "Automakers have realized this and the race is on for them to integrate their own solutions or partner with consumer electronics companies such as Google and Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="7">The moves by firms such as Skoda and BMW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars. Hannah Keshishian, an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel, told CNBC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40% of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle "would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle." This, she added, "opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity."</seg>

<seg id="1">Ghana: World Rabies Day Observed</seg>
<seg id="2">The 13th World Rabies Day was marked in Accra on Wednesday with a call on pet owners to vaccinate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citizenry.</seg>
<seg id="3">The programme which was held under the theme "Rabies: Vaccinate to eliminate" was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was aimed at highlighting the essential role of mass canine vaccination in rabies elimination in the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">Addressing the conference, the Assistant Director General and FAO Representative to Ghana, Mr Abebe Haile-Gabriel indicated that the issue of rabies could be minimised if efforts were geared towards vaccination and keeping stray animals away from humans especially children.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to him, the 'Zero by 30' Global Strategic Plan "of the 500,000 people who died from rabies each year, 40 per cent are children living in Asia and Africa," and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rabies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Haile-Gabriel stated that most stray animals carried rabies and re-echoed the need for the country to supplement the United against Rabies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vaccinate animals that carried zoonotic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">He underscored the need for the country to embark on five-year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rabies.</seg>
<seg id="9">A comprehensive roadmap for progressive elimination of rabies, he noted had been rolled out through the Ghana Rabies and Prevention Action Plan (2018-2030) to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Haile-Gabriel pledged the readiness of the FAO to collaborate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rabies in the country.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dr Owen Kaluwa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Representative to Ghana observed that rabies was an endemic which had to be controlled to save lives.</seg>
<seg id="12">He explained that through the "Zero human rabies deaths by 2030" strategy, countries were supported to develop and implement their national rabies elimination plans that embrace the One Health Concept and cross sectoral collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dr Kaluwa noted that 99 per cent of zoonotic disease like rabies was transmitted from dogs to humans, adding that One Health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies was expedient.</seg>
<seg id="14">Director of Veterinary Service, Dr Asiedu Baah lamented that rabies had become global burden.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Though rabies has no cure, the infection is vaccine preventable, hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated," he stated.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dr Baah said although rabies was fully preventable using appropriate sustainable control strategies, lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resourced to prevent transmission of rabies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 12-year-old who "silenced the world"</seg>
<seg id="2">Greta Thunberg has established herself as the planet's spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16. But long before social media, another teenager was scolding UN leaders on the world stage 27 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the year since she organized school walkouts in her native Sweden to protest climate change, Greta Thunberg's environmental crusade has been unavoidable, culminating on Monday in an angry and passionate speech before the UN's Climate Action Summit, in which she lambasted politicians for stealing her "dreams" and her "childhood" with "empty words" while humanity stares down "a mass extinction."</seg>
<seg id="4">Thunberg's grim pronouncements have earned her savage criticism, and glowing praise. New York Magazine called her "the Joan of Arc of climate change," while The Guardian ranked her speech alongside President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address for its historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then again, they said the same about Severn Cullis-Suzuki in 1992. Long before Thunberg deadpanned to parliamentarians that "we probably don't even have a future any more," and netizens tore each other to shreds attacking and defending her, 12-year-old Cullis-Suzuki became known as the "The girl who silenced the world for five minutes" when she delivered a similar sermon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tone of Cullis-Suzuki's speech is strikingly similar to Thunberg's. "We've come...to tell you adults that you must change your ways," she opened, just like Thunberg told the assembled adults "we will not let you get away with this."</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as Thunberg told the UN summit "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fairytales of eternal economic growth," Cullis-Suzuki told leaders that "losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market."</seg>
<seg id="8">And underpinning both girls" messages was a nihilistic fatalism. "I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone. I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it," Cullis-Suzuki said in 1992. Striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading "You'll die of old age, I'll die of climate change."</seg>
<seg id="9">The environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s, when deforestation, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour. Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years. Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban, ozone depletion has slowed dramatically, and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cullis-Suzuki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's Special Advisory Panel in the early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="11">So what does the future have in store for Thunberg? Well that depends how you look at Cullis-Suzuki's example. On one hand, none of her worst fears came to pass. On the other, world governments still have ecological problems to contend with, and are still being lectured by children about them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won't unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">By then, another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Martian colonies.</seg>

<seg id="1">SNP could support Jeremy Corbyn as temporary PM to stop no-deal Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The SNP has signalled it could support installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis to thwart a no-deal Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="3">As tensions between MPs and Downing Street deepened, Nicola Sturgeon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a caretaker prime minister until a general election.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn called on rebel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance, particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under the proposals, opposition parties would seek to oust Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a "terrible idea."</seg>
<seg id="8">Responding to a tweet suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister, she said: "Agree with this.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Vote of no confidence, opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Veteran MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election," the source told ITV's Robert Peston.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have. Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn."</seg>
<seg id="14">An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing "this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">The spokesperson said: "It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn. There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board.</seg>
<seg id="18">Labour argued that the plan was the "simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal."</seg>
<seg id="19">However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kirstene Hair, Tory MP for Angus, said: "This report confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There is no doubt that Corbyn's weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="22">"He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted "No" in what was meant to be a once in a generation event."</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma</seg>
<seg id="2">In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings. The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea. There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe." Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?</seg>
<seg id="5">As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.</seg>
<seg id="6">That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur. In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence. In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.</seg>
<seg id="7">I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?</seg>

<seg id="2">Being stuck on a long-haul flight within earshot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL), after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where toddlers will be seated.</seg>
<seg id="3">When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat, a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan, alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats.</seg>
<seg id="4">JAL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of earshot of a screaming infant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group, or if there was a last-minute change of aircraft, the airline's website said.</seg>
<seg id="6">JAL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticipating seat reservations by serial snorers and passengers who fully recline their seats during in-flight meals.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic. He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him. Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car. One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford. The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran. The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.</seg>
<seg id="8">This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said. "Did you go back and try to help him or what? Nobody said nothing."</seg>
<seg id="10">Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said. "As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to."</seg>
<seg id="12">As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here</seg>
<seg id="2">Humiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awaits Johnson in Brussels if he tries to weasel out of his commitments to request an extension. That will comfort European officials, who would most probably agree to it. Mainly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would be economically harmful to both sides.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bedlam in the UK lends itself to delay without decisions. Lawmakers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson's hands and seek an extension, but that's about all they can agree on. This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May's hard-fought Brexit deal with the EU three times. Unless there's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won't change.</seg>
<seg id="4">But even an election is a grim prospect for European capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit policy is a painful contortion act that's almost impossible to understand; the centrist Liberal Democrats' idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme. The longer this drags on, the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">There might be more optimism in Brussels if the outline of a workable deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the European Commission's Berlaymont headquarters. But there isn't.</seg>
<seg id="6">Johnson's regular bashing of his predecessor's "backstop" proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn't led to any convincing alternatives. Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren't concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Johnson's weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incentive to erase crucial red lines, despite the claim by Michael Gove, the UK minister in charge of a no-deal Brexit, that they're "shifting" on the backstop.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an ideal world, a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end. Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK, given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this drags on. If there's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament, the EU should grab it.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home.</seg>
<seg id="10">The EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them; it's less good at unilaterally imposing its will. The UK is hemmed in by its own internal contradictions, at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the impasse.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here.</seg>

<seg id="2">A gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The star, which was about the same size as our sun, was seen from 375 million light years away warping and spiralling into the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, researchers said in the Astrophysical Journal.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event.</seg>
<seg id="5">NASA's planet-searching telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - TESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS, whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets, caught the beginning of the violent event.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thomas Holoien, an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research, said: "This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward."</seg>
<seg id="8">Stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole, which lives at the centre of most galaxies, including the Earth's Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="9">The black hole's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart, with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole, forming a disc of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Holoien added: "Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. (The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)</seg>
<seg id="3">Many readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times's decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.</seg>
<seg id="4">We took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:</seg>
<seg id="5">The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower's account a "political hack job."</seg>
<seg id="6">We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.</seg>

<seg id="2">China on Friday said it has not provoked a "single war or conflict" or "invaded a single square" of foreign land, skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation," stated an official white paper released, four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on October 1.</seg>
<seg id="4">"China safeguards world peace through real actions. Over the past 70 years, China has not provoked a single war or conflict, nor invaded a single square of foreign land," the paper titled "China and the World in the New Era" said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The white paper, while highlighting the CPS's "peaceful rise" made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land, especially in the Aksai Chin area, occupied by China.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sino-India border dispute involving 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained unresolved. China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which India contests.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.</seg>
<seg id="8">Besides the 1962 war, India and China had a major military standoff at Doklam in 2017 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to lay a road close to India"s narrow Chicken Neck corridor connecting with the North-Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops.</seg>
<seg id="10">China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.</seg>
<seg id="11">"China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries, and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf," the white paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, the country has cut its armed forces "by over four million."</seg>
<seg id="12">The two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world's largest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India</seg>
<seg id="2">India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.</seg>
<seg id="6">Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.</seg>
<seg id="7">The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.</seg>
<seg id="8">The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. "This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.</seg>
<seg id="9">For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).</seg>
<seg id="10">Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.</seg>

<seg id="3">A report in Spanish newspaper El Pais said the company, UC Global SL, allegedly handed over audio and video to the CIA of meetings Assange held with his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company is being investigated over the claims by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, said the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assange filed a criminal complaint himself, in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his client-attorney privileges.</seg>

<seg id="7">In April, Assange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we still need Gandhi</seg>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the world's two largest democracies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 150th birthday we are currently celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi, who was born on Oct. 2, 1869, left a worldwide legacy with his focus on ethics, nonviolence, tolerance and social justice. He had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobilizations in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="4">The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the Rev. Martin Luther King's embrace of his ideals, with African-American activists such as Howard Thurman and Benjamin Mays undertaking long sea voyages to India to meet Gandhi.</seg>
<seg id="5">And Cesar Chavez, who modeled many of his tactics on Gandhi's in leading the farmworkers" movement, traced his political awakening to a newsreel he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that "this half-naked man without a gun had conquered the might of the British Empire."</seg>
<seg id="6">Outside the United States, Gandhi had a similar effect. Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists, to give just a few examples, have acknowledged Gandhi as a guiding light.</seg>
<seg id="7">But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who triumphantly addressed a joint mega-rally in Houston recently, seem to be impervious to Gandhi's ideas, despite paying lip service to him at the event. Both are right-wing populists who have ruled with scant compassion or tolerance, successfully mobilizing whites and Hindus in their respective countries as voting blocs, and fomenting division and social antagonism.</seg>
<seg id="8">Modi has belonged, since he was 8 years old, to a Hindu nationalist organization known as the RSS, an ex-member of which, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Gandhi on Jan. 30, 1948. Indeed, parliamentarians from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have heaped praise on Gandhi's killer in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Modi government's un-Gandhian approach has manifested itself on many fronts. It has stripped the Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and statehood and put it into lockdown. It has proven unwelcoming to the mostly Muslim Rohingya refugees who have fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="10">And Modi's government has created an uproar by instituting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Assam to ostensibly catch noncitizens from neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, a step that may end up disenfranchising and imprisoning almost 2 million people.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump is singing from a similar songbook. His administration's Muslim-majority travel ban echoes the Islamophobia that often informs Modi's policymaking. Its callousness toward refugees mirrors the Indian government's disdain for the Rohingya population's suffering, and its detention camps parallel the ones the Modi regime is setting up. Trump's stirring of racial animosity is analogous to troublesome rhetoric from a number of Modi's cabinet members.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was a teachable moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer at the event quoted Gandhi's definition of democracy as "something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong."</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump and Modi would do very well to keep Gandhi's advice in mind, 150 years after his birth.</seg>

<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.</seg>
<seg id="5">The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post. Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="6">A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.</seg>
<seg id="8">Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vulnerable Dems air impeachment concerns to Pelosi</seg>
<seg id="2">During the meeting, several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy, with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is "the focus of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="4">By keeping the impeachment inquiry focused, leaders hope to keep the caucus unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings. The Ukraine matter is also relatively clear-cut and easy to explain to the public, lawmakers say. They also argue the probe, spearheaded by the intelligence committee, will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrower scope.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rep. Angie Craig, a vulnerable freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that Pelosi and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm in a district where I've been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined, I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that," Craig said, adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told CNN that he wouldn't -- at this point -- vote for articles of impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I would vote no right now because we haven't seen all the facts," Cartwright said. "We have to presume that people are innocent, don't we, and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation, if if all that is true."</seg>
<seg id="9">Democrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impeachment soon, with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-week recess at the start of October. It will be the first time a swath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear, in-person feedback -- or, in some cases, blowback -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said the timing of the recess has its upsides.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I really can't think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward," he told reporters. "It's actually good timing that we get a chance to go home, catch our breath, get the perspective of people back home, explain what we're doing, and then come back and move forward accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Once lawmakers return, though, movement is likely to be quick.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think it's everybody's intention here to get this done in 2019," said Rep. Jamie Raskin, an impeachment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House, and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country," the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night. "We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public. And if we do our job right, it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman from New York who has resisted calls for an impeachment probe, told CNN that he's "not yet" there on impeaching Trump.</seg>
<seg id="16">"While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there's a lot more information that's out there," Brindisi said. "We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes."</seg>
<seg id="17">More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry, according to a CNN count. However, that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump. Even if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fallout from Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump official says lawyers had Ukraine call transcript moved to secure system</seg>
<seg id="2">A senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a highly secure system.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known, beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call.</seg>
<seg id="4">The whistleblower complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that White House officials said they were "directed" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept.</seg>
<seg id="5">The whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower also said that, according to White House officials, it was "not the first time" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. The complaint alleged that the White House tried to "restrict access" to records of the call.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the White House Situation Room," the whistleblower stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a "verbatim transcript" but is based on "notes and recollections" of those memorializing the call, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great," he said. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it...sounds horrible to me."</seg>
<seg id="9">This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings - where his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that the concerns were based on second-hand information.</seg>
<seg id="11">The White House lawyers" directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a "cover-up."</seg>
<seg id="12">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, called the move a "cover-up" and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow downplayed the importance of the record-keeping details.</seg>
<seg id="14">"A cover-up? Think about that for a moment," Sekulow said on "Fox & Friends" Friday. "The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It's so secret and such a cover-up, here's the documents. This is nonsense."</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Barr 'rogue'; former U.S. officials back investigation</seg>
<seg id="2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr Friday of going "rogue" to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine's leader, which has led to an impeachment inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="3">The California Democrat's words follow a release of the complaint Thursday, which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph Maguire.</seg>
<seg id="4">Barr is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call, as is Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani. The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to "lock down" the record of the call.</seg>
<seg id="5">"[Barr has] gone rogue," Pelosi told MSNBC Friday. "I think where they're going is a cover-up of a cover-up. I think it's sad, to have a Justice Department go so rogue. Well, they have been for a while. And now it just makes matters worse."</seg>
<seg id="6">Pelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he'd withheld military aid to Ukraine. The aid was ultimately granted, but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump's asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation. The coalition said Trump's actions constitute a "profound national security concern."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We applaud those members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, who have started us down that necessary path," the letter states. "President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It would also represent an effort to subordinate America's national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president's personal political interest."</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call. Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zelensky was a "perfect conversation"</seg>
<seg id="11">"Sounding more and more like the so-called whistle-blower isn't a whistle-blower at all," he tweeted. "In addition, all second-hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"</seg>
<seg id="12">Vice President Mike Pence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders, the whistle-blower complaint shows, and he met with Zelensky in Poland earlier this month. He said neither Joe Biden or Hunter Biden were discussed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Death of Chinese activist in police custody prompts calls for investigation into torture</seg>
<seg id="2">Human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a Chinese activist, arrested after holding up a placard calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wang Meiyu, 38, was detained in July after he stood outside the Hunan provincial police department holding a sign that called on Xi and Chinese premier Li Keqiang to resign and implement universal suffrage in China. He was later charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a vague offence often given to dissidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wang's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang's wife Cao Shuxia received a call from police notifying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of Hengyang where he had been held. The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Minsheng Guancha, a Chinese human rights group, Cao was later able to see Wang's body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes, mouth, ears and nose and there were bruises on his face.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang Meiyu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial killing criminally accountable," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Radio Free Asia, Cao said police pressured her to accept their statement that Wang's death had been an accident but she refused. An officer at the Hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case. Wang's mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000).</seg>
<seg id="8">"Giving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetrator is not true redress nor will it effectively prevent torture," said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at CHRD.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coerced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Wang's death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun, who died in police custody in July, Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year. Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014, detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since Monday, Wang's family has been placed under house arrest, according to CHRD. He has two young children. Others connected to his case have also come under pressure. Late on Wednesday, six armed police detained Xie Yang, a rights lawyer, and Chen Yanhui, an activist, who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang's case. They were released on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wang, who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished, has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2018 after he held up the placard calling for Xi's resignation, he wrote online of how police stormed into his home, ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"These idiots. They can't understand that even after these years of persecution, including being deprived of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical needles that caused me to vomit blood, I won't surrender."</seg>

<seg id="1">Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests increase</seg>
<seg id="2">Hong Kong police said Friday that students accounted for 29% of nearly 1,600 people detained in anti-democracy protests since June and urged young people to take the "straight and narrow path" as more major rallies are planned this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police public relations chief Tse Chun-chung said 207 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resumption of classes after the summer holiday, compared to 257 over the June-August period.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes, with some already charged in court. This included a 16-year-old charged recently with arson, which carries possible a life imprisonment upon conviction, a 13-year-old girl charged with desecrating Chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is an alarming trend to us," he said at a news conference. "It is worrying to see these youths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age. We appeal to all youngsters to rethink their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path."</seg>
<seg id="6">Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw. But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snowballed into a wider anti-China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing's creeping intrusion into Hong Kong's autonomy promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="7">Protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square Friday night against alleged abuse of power by police, waving anti-police banners and chanting pro-democracy slogans. The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watchdog agency that critics say is toothless and has no real investigative powers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police have approved a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday organized by the Civil Human Rights Front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the Umbrella Revolution, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage. That movement ended without any government concession.</seg>
<seg id="10">Protesters are also organizing "anti-totalitarianism" rallies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China's tyranny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tse appealed to protesters to stop hijacking peaceful protests, like what happened in previous rallies when some lobbed gasoline bombs, set off street fires and vandalized public utilities. Police have responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other measures, prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that could embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup. In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate. Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys. Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG. It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business. Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Does glyphosate cause cancer?</seg>
<seg id="10">Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA. Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks. Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other. Bayer is contesting the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="14">A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals. However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in Texas</seg>
<seg id="2">A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six members of his extended family in Texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Harris County jury found Ronald Haskell, 39, guilty in the July 2014 killings of six members of the Stay family: parents Stephen Stay and Katie Stay, and children Bryan, 13, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7 and Zach, 4.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We are grateful for the jurors' rapt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case," Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. "There was never a reasonable doubt that Haskell meticulously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family."</seg>
<seg id="5">Police have said that Haskell traveled from California to the Houston suburb of Spring and ambushed his ex-wife's sister, her husband and their five children in their home.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Stays and four of their children were fatally shot in the back of their heads, and a fifth child, who was 15 at the time, survived. That teen, Cassidy, was grazed in the head by a bullet and played dead.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case, but jurors will decide whether Haskell should receive a death sentence or life in prison.</seg>
<seg id="8">At trial, the defense argued that Haskell was insane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people, NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston reported. After the verdict was read Thursday, he hung his head.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think he took it as best as you could expect," said Doug Durham, one of Haskell's defense attorneys, according to the station. "He was aware that this was a strong possibility."</seg>
<seg id="10">The sentencing phase begins Monday. Haskell defense attorney Neil Davis III said his team will work "to save his life. That's our job," according to KPRC.</seg>
<seg id="11">The sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cassidy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members. She appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday, according to KPRC.</seg>
<seg id="13">At a 2014 memorial for her family, Cassidy thanked the community for its support and said that she was comforted knowing her parents, two brothers and two sisters are "in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day."</seg>
<seg id="14">Haskell was disguised as a FedEx delivery driver when he went to the Stay home, apparently looking for his ex-wife, who is Katie Stay's sister.</seg>
<seg id="15">He forced his way inside and tied up Cassidy, officials said. When the rest of her family returned minutes later, Haskell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex-wife. They said they didn't know, and they were each shot in the back of the head.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cassidy, who was wounded, played dead until Haskell left, and was able to identify him to police. She told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents' home and kill them. But police tracked down Haskell, and he was arrested after a 20-minute police chase and a three-hour standoff.</seg>

<seg id="1">US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vaping and e-cigarette ads</seg>
<seg id="2">A BAN on advertising for e-cigarettes and vaping products, is being considered by ministers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in "the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would "not hesitate" to act.</seg>
<seg id="5">It comes as it emerged a vaping-related illness had claimed two more lives, bringing the total number of fatalities to 11.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its safety is still not entirely known.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the US, more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-cigarettes. Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday. Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness, with lives lost in eight states.</seg>
<seg id="9">While most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only "heavy nicotine vaping."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness, and has warned citizens against smoking e-cigarette products until more is known, particularly if modified or bought "off the street."</seg>
<seg id="11">The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere "closely," following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping.</seg>
<seg id="12">She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Our approach has been a precautionary one, which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products," she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids.</seg>
<seg id="16">"In Scotland, we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the coming months, we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products."</seg>
<seg id="18">She added: "It is important to stress, and for all of us to remember, that those devices are relatively new and, therefore, their impact continues to be studied. We do not yet fully understand what that impact is, which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm.</seg>
<seg id="21">"While we already have among the strictest regimes on those products, if the evidence shows that further action is needed... we will not hesitate to take it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Cambodian court charges exiled politicians with rebellion</seg>
<seg id="2">A Cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plotting armed rebellion for planning to return from self-imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cambodia National Rescue Party to oust the government would also be risking a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="4">The returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty, and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years. Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered plotting to topple the government, Justice Ministry spokesman Chin Malin was quoted as saying.</seg>
<seg id="5">The court's charges on Thursday are the latest salvo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader Sam Rainsy announced plans to return from more than three years of exile on Nov. 9 to seek a "restoration of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="6">Nov. 9 is Cambodia's independence day, celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 1953.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My calls to the people and the armed forces of #Cambodia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country's political life including genuine elections," Sam Rainsy said on Twitter earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">His opposition party was dissolved by the courts ahead of last year's general election, ensuring that an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen continued his four decades in power.</seg>
<seg id="9">The party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election, and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated, with Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party fearful that it could lose power in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hun Sen's government seems unnerved by the planned return of opposition politicians, though the effort appears to be a quixotic one, with Sam Rainsy calling on Cambodian workers in Thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Officials have vowed to arrest Sam Rainsy on his arrival, but there is speculation that Cambodia may simply bar him from entry, which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban. Neighboring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sam Rainsy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal defamation. Other legal cases have since been lodged against him by the government.</seg>
<seg id="14">Other top party members fled into exile during a late 2017 crackdown on all opposition to Hun Sen, which included the arrest of the party's co-founder, Kem Sokha. He was charged with treason, based on his links to a U.S. pro-democracy organization, and is under strict house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="2">A Florida man has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a plastic surgeon who was tortured with a blowtorch in an extortion attempt.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Sun Sentinel reports 34-year-old Justin Boccio pleaded guilty Thursday to kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the January attack on the surgeon, who hasn't been publicly identified.</seg>
<seg id="4">Boccio's attorney, Kenneth Lange, said his client was convinced to take part in the scheme by co-defendant, Serge Nkorina, who's being extradited from Tenerife, Spain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Court documents say the surgeon was leaving a Walmart store when he was confronted by an armed man and shoved into a van. They say he was tortured for hours before being returned to his car while unconscious. Surveillance video supports the chain of events.

<seg id="2">The U.S. is sending a Patriot missile battery, four ground-based radar systems, and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior, officials announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">A THAAD missile defense system and two additional Patriot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed, the Pentagon said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said more troops would deploy to the Middle East as a "defensive" measure to help protect against attacks from Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">Esper said the deployment was a first step toward addressing Iran's increasingly violent acts in the region -- including this month's drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Sept. 14 attack on the world's largest oil processing plant and a major oil field, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly. Iran has denied involvement in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is clear [...] that the weapons used were Iranian-produced and were not launched from Yemen," Esper said Friday, noting that all signs indicate "Iran was responsible for the attack."</seg>
<seg id="9">The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to "send a clear message that the United States supports our partners" and provide a "free flow of resources," Esper said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The U.S. calls on other countries to also "stand up and condemn the attacks," as well as contribute capabilities, the secretary said.</seg>

<seg id="3">In an interview with Deadline.com following the airing of Suits' finale in the US, Korsh was asked if there was "any possibility" of the former actress being asked "to do even a small cameo."</seg>

<seg id="5">"I thought about asking, and I thought about even using audio footage - that we have to come up with something - and in the end I didn't ask, and I just thought, 'I'm going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask'.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Duchess of Sussex appeared in archive Suits footage during the finale's montage.</seg>
<seg id="8">She starred as Rachel Zane in the New York-set legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare just as well without radiotherapy, a major study has found.</seg>
<seg id="3">The findings, from the the largest ever trial examining those having surgery for the disease, could spare thousands from gruelling treatment which can have distressing side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Royal Marsden study involved 1,400 men being treated for prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half were given immediate radiotherapy, which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease. The rest were monitored and only given radiotherapy if there were signs that disease had returned.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scientists found that five years later, there was almost no difference in disease recurrence between the two groups, with those who did not have treatment faring slightly better.</seg>
<seg id="7">Progression free survival was 85 per cent in the radiotherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups, after data was adjusted to take account of other factors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The study, funded by Cancer Research UK, found those who had radiotherapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsening of urinary incontinence, one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.</seg>
<seg id="10">One year after surgery 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radiotherapy suffered a deterioration, compared to 2.7 per cent who had standard care.</seg>

<seg id="1">Seth Dunlap Louisiana: WWL Radio host threatening to sue over anti-gay tweet sent the tweet himself, station claims, similar to Jussie Smollett case</seg>
<seg id="2">A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay slur, sent to him from the radio station's Twitter account. On Wednesday, WWL host Seth Dunlap, who is openly gay, said he planned to sue the station's parent company after working for years in a homophobic and hostile workplace. In a strange turn of events Thursday, the New Orleans Police Department said the homophobic tweet sent to Dunlap came from none other than Dunlap's phone.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet in question was sent earlier this month and the day it was sent, Dunlap hosted his show as usual. But the next day, he announced a leave of absence, CBS affiliate WWL-TV reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a statement, Dunlap said 14 people had access WWL's Twitter account. He claimed he was not one of the people with access to the account.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, he decided to take a polygraph test to dispel any speculation that he was the one who sent the tweet to himself, his lawyer Megan Kiefer, said. A lawsuit has not yet been filed on Dunlap's behalf, but he said in his statement that one would be coming, according to WWL-TV.</seg>
<seg id="6">WWL Radio, which is a CBS News Radio affiliate but is owned by Entercom, said in a statement it had investigated the tweet and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials. "WWL has completed its investigation into the highly offensive, unauthorized tweet sent from WWL's Twitter account on September 10, which directed a homophobic slur at Seth Dunlap," said WWL Radio in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement. At this point, the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings," the statement continue.</seg>
<seg id="8">The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet and in a police report Thursday revealed a twist in the story: The homophobic slur was allegedly sent from Dunlap's personal cellphone.</seg>
<seg id="9">Radio host Seth Dunlap claimed he worked in a homophobic and hostile workplace for years. After allegedly receiving a tweet with an anti-gay slur from the radio station's Twitter, he threatened to sue.</seg>
<seg id="10">WWL accused Dunlap of threatening the station for money, NOLA.com reports. WWL alleged the 35-year-old radio host said he would "scorch the earth" over the tweet and then demanded over $1.8 million in compensation. According to a police report obtained by NOLA.com, WWL said Dunlap made this threat when he was facing personal financial issues.</seg>
<seg id="11">The allegations were made by WWL's senior vice president Kevin Cassidy and attorneys for the parent company, Entercom. The police department is still working to corroborate the allegations, but have classified the case as possible extortion. In the state of Louisiana, extortion is defined as "the communication of threats to another with the intention (to) obtain anything of value."</seg>

<seg id="5">"I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified," Davis said. "I don't care what else I've done in my life -- I've won an Emmy, I've won an Oscar, two Tonys -- but if I mess this up, this is going to be a defining moment in my life."</seg>

<seg id="2">A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Steven Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died of an accidental overdose last year of cocaine, alcohol and the powerful opioid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ryan Reavis, 36, who was arrested in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, this week is accused of serving as Walter's "runner," who delivered the pills to Pettit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Walter, who is on supervised release over a 2005 drug case, remains in custody.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, Miller's lyrics included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was also in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, Thank U Next, that lovingly mentioned him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and overdoses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.</seg>

<seg id="2">A woman accused of shoplifting at a Walmart in Mexico City took drastic measures to prove her innocence, stripping stark naked in the middle of the supermarket as a stunned security guard looked on.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a video of the incident, filmed at the Tepeyac Walmart branch in Mexico City earlier this week, a security guard can be seen approaching a woman apparently suspected of theft as she neared the store's exit. Her reaction once she was stopped, however, left the watchman speechless.</seg>
<seg id="4">The woman first peels off her skirt and begins to proceed toward the exit, but, perhaps unsatisfied her guilt was yet assuaged, soon turned around to remove her shirt as well. Now fully nude, she stormed off, clothes in hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">The birthday-suited shopper's identity remains unknown, though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impromptu peep show.</seg>
<seg id="6">Similar bizarre sights are nothing new for Walmart. In July, security cameras caught a Pennsylvania woman relieving herself into a bin of potatoes at a Walmart in the town of West Mifflin. The woman, who is visibly intoxicated in the footage, was charged with open lewdness, public drunkenness, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for the deed, and became a viral sensation to boot.</seg>
<seg id="7">In another case of compelled supermarket nudity this week, a British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to expose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious "bulge" in his pants. He hadn't stolen anything.</seg>

<seg id="3">West Bengal government has plans to set up a museum at the north Kolkata house of 19th century social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar where he had spent the last few years of his life, state minister Partha Chatterjee said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The museum will come up at Vidyasagar's residence at Badur Bagan area where pictures and models, chronicling his life from his birth place at Birsinghapur village in Paschim Medinipur district to the house in north Kolkata, will be put on display, he said on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="6">The minister also released two books, "Amader Vidyasagar" and "Chotoder Vidyasagar" at the programme.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some items used by Vidyasagar, gathering dust in the storeroom of the house, will be brought out for public viewing at the museum.</seg>
<seg id="8">This will help the present generation to know about the man, who had waged a war against women oppression and propagated widow remarriage, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The School Education and Higher Education department will organise seminars highlighting Vidaysagar's life and work in schools and colleges during a year-long programme, Mr Chatterjee said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Listing other activities to be taken up by the academy, Mr Chatterjee said that a collection of hitherto unknown writings by Vidyasagar will be published.</seg>
